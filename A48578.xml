            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WHat hath hitherto been ſaid of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> hath been either little conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Truth, or elſe hath only mention'd the leaſt part of thoſe things which ought to be known. The time I ſpent there, which was from the beginning of the year 1672. until the end of the year 1674, during the Embaſſy of the Count <hi>d' Avaux,</hi> firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned me the Thoughts of making a moſt lively and natural Deſcription of this City, their Government, with the manner of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending in the Three Parts of this Work, whatſoever other Authors hath ſeparately ſaid of it, which, I can ſay, hath been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfect. Theſe Affairs do ſeem to me ſo extraordinary and particular, that I cannot think them leſs different from the other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> than the Kingdom of <hi>China</hi> is from that part of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102922:3"/>
Yet the better to ſucceed in this Deſign, and to draw an exact Copy from this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Original, I have not only applied my ſelf to the ſtricteſt Enquiries during my abode there, and to the Converſation of Perſons tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly inſtructed, with all the Maxims of this Repulick; but I did likewiſe conſult their Chronicles, the Annal Manuſcripts of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Regiſter-Book of Families, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which the moſt experienc'd Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have made of them<hi>:</hi> inſomuch that by adding theſe Informations to thoſe which I gathered from the Chief Hiſtorians of the Republick, and the moſt exacteſt Remarks of all the ſingularities of <hi>Venice,</hi> I ought to believe that I ſhall no ways deceive my ſelf in the livelyneſs of my propoſed At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>However it hapned that the Author of the Hiſtory of the Government <note place="margin">Amelot de la Houſſaie.</note> of <hi>Venice,</hi> who was emploied in the preceding Embaſſy, did likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon a Deſign much like to mine. His Book appearing when mine was juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the Preſs, occaſioned me to believe I had taken all this Labour to no purpoſe. So I thought no farther of the pains I had taken after the Impreſſion of a Book, which had ſo general an Approbation. As I know not the Author, ſo I am not poſſeſs'd with
<pb facs="tcp:102922:3"/>
any partiality to ſpeak either well or ill of him: Yet as I am able to judge of his Book with more aſſurance, than they leſs converſant with the Affairs of this City; ſo I think my ſelf oblig'd to ſay he hath penetrated into all the Myſteries of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Republique, upon which ſubject ſcarce any thing hath eſcap'd his Enquiries: But I leave others to judge if he hath not ſhewn too much Paſſion, as likewiſe what reaſon the Republick had to complain of him.</p>
                  <p>Having paſs'd over Four Years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther Thoughts of what I had written of <hi>Venice;</hi> I ſhould without doubt have been ſilent all the reſt of my Life, if ſome Perſons to whom I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated my deſign, upon my Return from <hi>Venice,</hi> had not engag'd me to go on with my firſt Reſolution. The Draught and ſubject-matter of the Treatiſe ſeem'd ſo particular and curious, eſpecially the Firſt and Third Part, that they were ſo much perſuaded, as they likewiſe induced me to be of the ſame Opinion, that the ſeveral Deſcriptions of thoſe Matters there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, were not leſs important to ſhew the Maxims of the Republick, and the Genius of this People, than the moſt refined Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that can be made upon the Policy of their Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102922:4"/>
To give the ampler ſatisfaction in what may be expected from me, as likewiſe to avoid preſenting the Publick with a Work filled with the ſame things, that other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may poſſibly already have better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, than I can here deſcribe; I have thought fit to prune this of whatſoever I had ſaid of the Intereſts and Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this Government, with the ſeveral Potentates of <hi>Europe.</hi> I ſtruck out ſeveral Obſervations that at preſent ſeem unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and have likewiſe abridg'd the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Strength and Revenue of the State; neither have I ſpoke of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions they poſſeſs, becauſe thoſe Matters are amply Treated in another place<hi>:</hi> So I have particularly applied my ſelf to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I judg'd neceſſary to my Deſign. I have left it to the Readers liberty to draw ſuch Conſequences, as may be eaſily deduc'd from all the moſt Eſſential paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and whereſoever I have touch'd upon their Policy and Maxims of Government, it hath been with the greateſt Care.</p>
                  <p>My Deſcription of <hi>Venice</hi> in the Firſt Part of this Treatiſe, will without all doubt be allowed to be very exact; and what I ſay of this wonderful City, will not be only as much to the commedation of it, as whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever her own Hiſtorians hath written to
<pb facs="tcp:102922:4"/>
the Glory of her; but it is likewiſe ſo juſtly taken from the Life, that it will paſs free of that flattery which is ever obſerved in Authors writing of their own Country. In the Second Part, which is of the Government of the Republick; I have added nothing of my own, either in relation to the riſe of <hi>Venice,</hi> the divers Revolutions that have been in the form of her Government; or as to the rigorous Conduct of the Council of Ten, and the Inquiſitors of State: for of one ſide I have faithfully followed what is found in the Annals of <hi>Venice;</hi> and on the other I have mentioned only ſuch things, as might be known to them who have made any ſtay at <hi>Venice;</hi> for one can ſcarce be there any time, without ſeeing or hearing of ſome very extraordinary things.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Part I have render'd to the Antient <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, all the Juſtice that is due to their Quality. The Proofs which I have given of the Antiquity of their Extraction, may poſſibly convince ſuch, who either out of Ignorance or Prepoſſeſſion do conteſt with them that illuſtrious Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. In the Third Part, I have amply deſcrib'd the Conduct of the young Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with their particular Cuſtoms; and the better to ſhew all the ſingularities of them, there is the manner of living of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb facs="tcp:102922:5"/>
all the different degrees of People; to which I have added an exact Deſcription of all the publick diverſions of <hi>Venice,</hi> to ſhew the mighty difference, between the reliſh of this People, and thoſe of other Nations.</p>
                  <p>I am of the Opinion, that the Method herein obſerved will not a little contribute to the Beauty which I have particularly aim'd at in this Treatiſe. I thought it moſt Expedient firſt to give an Idea of the City before I entred into the Riſe of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and the Particulars of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I thought it likewiſe neceſſary to have ſome knowledge of the Nobility, before I ſpoke of their Councils which are the Soul of the State. And as the Cuſtoms and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living of the Inhabitants do not leſs depend on the Laws of the Government, than the publick Diverſions upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Place, ſo I have handled theſe two Heads in the Third Part.</p>
                  <p>I did not think fit to draw into one Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the Laws of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Policy, as judging they would be better diſperſed in the ſeveral Places, according to the Subject of the Diſcourſe; ſo they will be ſure to make a greater impreſſion upon the Mind of the Reader, whoſe Memory being fixed, and by this means aſſiſted, will more eaſily preſerve an Idea of them. However, I have
<pb facs="tcp:102922:5"/>
endeavoured to keep every thing to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Place and particular Chapter, as well to avoid Repetitions, as not to be oblig'd to ſeek for one and the ſame thing in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral different Places. For theſe Reaſons and to avoid tiring the Reader with tedious Digreſſions and troubleſome References, I have ſo ordered it, that whatſoever might ſeem obſcure, is ever explain'd by what hath been ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>I could very much wiſh I had been able to write with more Politeneſs, yet am in hopes that the ſingularity of the Subject will make amends for the faults of the Stile: and as I have no other end in this Treatiſe than to ſhew a great many things of which we were very ignorant, without being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to it by any other Reaſon or Deſign; ſo I hope it will be favourably received.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I only deſire that the ſmall pains I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to bring this into our Language, and to divert the Inquiſitive, may make amends for what ſhall be found amiſs in the Tranſlation.</hi>

                     <p>THere is ſcarce any one who hath not heard, that the City of <hi>Venice</hi> is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Sea; yet it is not an eaſie matter to form to ones ſelf a true Idea of the particular Diſpoſition of this Place, ſeeing among thoſe who have been there, and that have likewiſe made ſome ſtay, there are many that do confound the Sea with the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> without ever obſerving that theſe are abſolutely diſtinct from the Sea; as being certain great Plains
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102922:10"/>
which induſtrious Nature hath purpoſely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed, deſigning to render the Situation of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> not leſs ſtrong, than agreeable.</p>
                     <p>Above thoſe Places, in the bottom of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Gulph, on the Weſt ſide, where the Rivers <hi>Fo</hi> and <hi>Adigè</hi> fall into the Sea, Nature hath oppoſed the Violence of the Winds by a mighty Dike, which runs from the South to the North for the ſpace of about 35 Leagues, and 5 or 600 Paces in breadth, which defends the Country from being eaſily overflown; but the Sea having forced this Neck of Land, hath made it ſelf ſix Paſſages in ſo many ſeveral places, which overflowing all the low Grounds beyond this Bank, gave occaſion to this <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> Lagunes.</note> Name of <hi>Lagunes,</hi> leaving in this great Diſtrict ſeveral Iſlands about 5 or 6 Miles in compaſs, which are not much above the ſurface of the Water.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lagunes</hi> lie from South to North againſt the <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Continent, or</hi> Terra firma.</note> main Land, from the <hi>Poleſin,</hi> towards the <hi>Po</hi> and <hi>Adigè;</hi> from the <hi>Padouan,</hi> to the <hi>Brente;</hi> from the <hi>Themiſan</hi> and <hi>Friuli,</hi> towards the Mouth of the <hi>Plavis,</hi> or <hi>Anaſſus,</hi> making a great Demi-Oval, which is cloſed towards the Sea by the before-mentioned Remainders of the Neck of Land, being ſo many natural Defences againſt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driatick;</hi> and whereby the Sea hath here made the ſame number of diſtinct Iſlands, as ſhe hath opened Paſſages to drown the low Country, and form the <hi>Lagunes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſix Paſſages by which the Sea falls into the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> are the only Ports by which one paſſes from the Sea to this City. The firſt, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102922:10"/>
begin at the moſt Southern part, is the Port of <hi>Brondolo,</hi> which being almoſt ſtopt up with the Sands, by reaſon of the <hi>Adigè,</hi> and the falling in here of the new <hi>Brente,</hi> is now no more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is the Port of <hi>Chioſa,</hi> an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal City, ſituated 24 Miles from <hi>Venice,</hi> and is ſomething like it, by reaſon of the Situation and Canals.</p>
                     <p>The third is the Port of <hi>Malamoco,</hi> from the Village of that Name; here all the great Ships come, as being deeper than any of the other Ports; the Road is very good, and capable of containing a great number of Ships.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is the Port of the <hi>Lido,</hi> over-againſt the moſt Eaſtern Point of <hi>Venice,</hi> and only a Mile from it. Through this Port, the Gallies and other great Veſſels, after having unladed at the <hi>Lazaret</hi> of <hi>Malamoco,</hi> paſs on to St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Place, as alſo to ſeveral other places of the City, by the means of the great Canal which croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it.</p>
                     <p>There is above the <hi>Lido</hi> the Mouth of St. <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and ſomething further that of the <hi>Three Ports,</hi> ſo called by reaſon of the three Openings pretty near one the other; but the Water is ſo low in theſe places, that they are only frequented by the Boats of Fiſhermen.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſeen by what is here ſaid, that <hi>Venice</hi> is naturally defended againſt all the Attacks of a Naval Force, being the Ships cannot come any nearer than the Port of <hi>Malamoco;</hi> for thoſe that would paſs on to <hi>Venice</hi> by the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunes,</hi> are obliged, after being unladed, to be towed up through certain Paſſages, where the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102922:11"/>
deepneſs of the Water, ſufficient for Ships of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, is marked out by great Piles; or elſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Sea, taking the ſame courſe that the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies do, and come in through the Port of the <hi>Lido:</hi> For the great Currant of the Water hath preſerved here, by means of the Flood, a deeper Channel than is found in any other part of the <hi>Lagunes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of all the Ports, that of the <hi>Lido</hi> is moſt in their Eye, being the neareſt to the City, and the eaſieſt to be approached; but the Republick hath taken care of it by a well fortified Caſtle, with Water-Batteries on the right; on the left is only a Wall for Musketiers, whoſe Diſcharges muſt be of very good effect, being the entrance of the Port is nothing near Musket-ſhot over.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding this advantagious Situation of this City, Experience hath ſhewn, that if a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Army ſhould get the Poſſeſſion of one of theſe Paſſages, the City of <hi>Venice</hi> would be in a little time reduced to great Extremities; as it happened in the year 1380, in the War between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> who by the taking of the Port of <hi>Chioſa,</hi> under their General <hi>Doria,</hi> ſtruck the City into ſuch a Fear, that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in the Senate, if they ſhould abandon the Town, and tranſport themſelves to <hi>Candia.</hi> This Deliberation had been followed with the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, if they had not at that time received the News of the Victory they gained at Sea by a General <hi>Victor Piſani,</hi> under the Doge <hi>Andre Contarini</hi> there in Perſon, which came ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely, as to deliver the Republick from the moſt terrible Fear they ever knew.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102922:11"/>
Wherefore as the Entrances of <hi>Malamoco</hi> and the <hi>Lido</hi> are the moſt important, and a Deſcent made at the firſt of theſe Ports, would eaſily render the Enemy Maſters of the ſecond, by poſſeſſing the whole Iſle between them, which is not above 5 Miles long, and 4 or 500 Paces broad, ſo the Republick hath cauſed it to be cut near the <hi>Lido,</hi> by a <note n="*" place="margin">A deep Ditch.</note> 
                        <hi>Foſsè</hi> that croſſes it, fortified with Baſtions, their Caſemats, and Courtines faced with Brick towards <hi>Malamoque,</hi> which is the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Venice</hi> enjoys more Security towards the ſide of the main Land; for in all that compaſs of Ground which borders upon the <hi>Lagunes</hi> towards the Weſt, there are only two principal Ways that lead to the City; the one is a Village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Meſtre,</hi> where all things are brought which come out of <hi>Germany</hi> to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> by the means of a Canal that goes into the <hi>Lagunes.</hi> The other is called <hi>Lizza Fuſina;</hi> here ends the old Canal of the <hi>Breute:</hi> This Water is prevented from falling into the <hi>Lagunes</hi> by a Sluce, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Prejudice it might occaſion. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever comes from <hi>Padua,</hi> and from the greateſt part of the Territories of <hi>Venice,</hi> is brought to <hi>Fuſina,</hi> if it does not go down the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Rivers.</p>
                     <p>The Paſſages that lead from theſe two Places to <hi>Venice,</hi> as likewiſe ſome others leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are not direct, but marked out at certain Diſtances by high Piles, which the Republick are ſure to have cut in any preſſing Neceſſity, rendering the City inacceſſible to all Enemies on that ſide. For however ſmall their Boats may

                     <p>King <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. in Confederacy with moſt Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> that Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> had Armed againſt the <hi>Venetians;</hi> after having beaten their Army, advanced to <hi>Fuſina,</hi> from whence the City of <hi>Venice</hi> is plainly ſeen: Here he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to attempt the paſſage of the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> in order to render himſelf Maſter of the City; but the Pope having recovered <hi>Romagnia,</hi> that was not only uſurp'd from him, but the chief occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the war, became unwilling to ſee the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ruine of the Republick, and the too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful eſtabliſhment of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf from the <hi>Ligue;</hi> which gave the addreſs of the <hi>Venetians</hi> opportunity to ſeparate the reſt, and diſperſe that terrible Storm which muſt have ruin'd them beyond recovery.</p>

In effect, the diminution of the Waters depth is ſo conſiderable, that formerly where there was Eight and Ten Fathom Water in the Port of <hi>Malamoco,</hi> there is not at preſent above Two or Three; inſomuch that the great Ships are now oblig'd to take the opportunity of the higheſt of the Tide to get out. They muſt be undoubtedly miſtaken who believe the Sea rather retires, than the Land grows upon them; it being evident that the common Tides beat againſt the foundations of the moſt Ancient Palaces and other Edifices of <hi>Venice,</hi> which are not of a much younger Date than the very Foundation of the Republick it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Theſe inconveniences being of the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, have put the Republick to an inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible charge within theſe laſt Forty years: They are very ready to hear all Enginiers that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with the cleanſing and keeping the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunes</hi> clear of Mud: For which reaſon they have always at hand a great number of vaſt Machines both to ſcour them, and deepen the Canals. As the Republick is of the Opinion that theſe Beds of Earth are particularly cauſed by the falling in of the <hi>Brente</hi> and <hi>Piave,</hi> occaſioning the Sand to ſettle here; ſo they thought by an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Work to take ſuch meaſures as might prevent it, by turning the courſe, and conveying the Water towards <hi>Brondoto,</hi> a new Canal cut in the Plains, for above Thirty Miles together. So theſe Waters are carried above the entrance of the Three Ports by little Channels; which being ſcarce able to reſiſt againſt the rapidity of the Stream, are found to be a great Charge and not much Benefit.</p>

Some believe that this diminution of the depth proceeds from the enlarging of the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> to which purpoſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> levell'd a high Dyke, that was formerly from the Town of <hi>Chioſa</hi> to <hi>Lizza Fuſina</hi> conſequently above Twenty Miles long; for it being directly oppoſite to the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sea, ſo it was alſo the occaſion of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with greater force, which did not only car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away that Filth and Mud which now remains ſince the motion is abated by the liberty of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that great ſpace, but likewiſe the courſe being at that time more rapid, did then ſcour the Port of <hi>Malamoco,</hi> which is over againſt it.</p>

The greateſt part of the Canals in the heart of the City are very narrow, and have no Keys; which evidently ſhews that the firſt Founders of <hi>Venice</hi> were mighty Husbands in managing the Ground that was ſo precious, or that they had not in their thoughts the Idea of what this City hath ſince attain'd.</p>
                     <p>Some of the other Canals have but one ſingle Key, and others <note place="margin">Il Fundamento.</note> two, but ſo narrow that two People can hardly walk together; yet there are ſome very ſpacious and convenient, but without either Rails or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſters, open and made into Stairs over againſt each Houſe, which deſcend very low, for the more eaſie uſe of the Gondolo's at all times of the Tide; by which means thoſe frequent deſcents or ſtairs, have ſo <note place="margin">La Riva.</note> ſtraitned the Keys, that all Paſſengers, more eſpecially in the Night, are oblig'd to keep cloſe to the ſides of the Houſes, or otherwiſe at almoſt every ſtep expoſe themſelves to the dangers of the Canal.</p>
                     <p>The depth of theſe Canals are different; but when the Tide is at the higheſt it is in moſt places 5 or 6 Foot, excepting the great Canal, of which the depth is very conſiderable; it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a worthy Subject of admiration, but more in thoſe parts of the Town moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by the poorer People, to ſee the great numbers of little Children playing upon the very ſides and edges of theſe Canals, which in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places would affect the Parents with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual apprehenſion of their falling into the Water, yet, it no ways troubles them here, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſcarce known that any ſuch accidents happen in theſe places.</p>

Moſt part of the Bridges of <hi>Venice</hi> are made of Stone and Brick, ſo delicately Built that the Arch is not above 8 Inches thick, but the ſides and middle are of a very hard ſort of free Stone, the Arches are ſo high that the paſſage is no ways incommodious to the <hi>Gondolo's</hi> and other Veſſels that are continually paſſing the Canals. You aſcend theſe Bridges on either ſide by 4 or 5 ſteps of white Stone that is much like Marble, which in time become ſo ſmooth and poliſh'd, that in a Rain or Froſty weather it is very difficult to keep from falling; as theſe Bridges are without Rails or any other ſecurity, ſo one ought to have a ſpecial regard to their Feet; for the white Stone is one of the 3 things that the <hi>Venetian</hi> Proverb recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to the care of all Stangers.</p>

It is on both ſides adorn'd with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Palaces of <hi>Venice;</hi> but beſide the want of a Key that might continue it as a Terraſs from one end to the other, there is a great number of little Houſes among them, which do diminiſh thoſe advantages that would be otherwiſe due to theſe magnificent Buildings.</p>
                     <p>In ſeveral other places of this City may be ſeen many noble Houſes and Palaces: But without detaining my ſelf here upon this Deſcription of them, I ſhall only add that as the 2 Palaces of <hi>Cornaro</hi> and <hi>Grimani</hi> upon the great Canal, are the moſt Magnificent of all, ſo their Frontiſpieces may ſerve as Models to the Buildings of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princes. Beſides theſe, one ſees upon the great Canal, and in all other parts of this City a great number of the more antique Artichecture, whoſe Fronts being adorn'd with large Balconies of Marble both in the firſt and ſecond Floors, do evidently demonſtrate the Ancient Wealth and Power of this Republick.</p>
                     <p>The Water of the great Canal by reaſon of the great depth is always clean and clear, the Currant in the flux and reflux of the Tide, is not much leſs Rapid than thoſe of Rivers.

This Bridge was Built of Wood until the Year 1587, at which time the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, under the Doge <hi>Paſcal Cigogne,</hi> caus'd it to be built with Stone: The greateſt Ararchitects of the Age were conſulted about this magnificent Work; among the ſeveral Deſigns, that of one Arch was preferr'd to all the others; which is ſo large that a Gally with her Maſt let down, can at all times go through it, and her Oars rowing.</p>
                     <p>The foundation of this Bridge is on each ſide laid upon 10000 Elm Piles, after having firſt by a prodigious Charge kept up the Water in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain deep places, until they had ſunk 16 Foot into the Earth, to render the Work more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial.

                     <p>This Bridge hath on each ſide 2 rows of ſhops, whoſe Timber-work being rais'd Arbour like, and covered with Lead, renders the appearance of it very agreeable; there is in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this double row of Shops a ſpace mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately large; from hence you go up ſeveral ſteps

until you come to the uppermoſt part, which is open on both ſides like a Porch, here you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on both hands the proſpect of the great Canal, and enter into the 2 Corrido's or Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which being behind the Shops, continue from one end of the Bridge to the other: A great Balluſtrade, with very handſom Corniſhes is the ſupport of theſe 2 Galleries; the whole is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular a Piece of Artichecture, that this Bridge is of an extream advantageous effect to the beauty of the great Canal.</p>

                     <p>BEſides the exceſſive charges of building more Bridges upon the great Canal, I am of the opinion that the hinderance they would be to the continual paſſage of great Veſſels, and the prejudice that the beauty of the proſpect would receive, may be allow'd to be ſufficient reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch attempts; moreover the Policy of this Government is that they may be able in any ſudden Revolution, to defend one part of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the other, which would be no difficult matter, ſeeing there is but one Bridge to defend:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102922:18"/>
But as it would be an extream inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency to the Inhabitants, if they were oblig'd to paſs the Bridge upon every <note place="margin">Li Tragetti.</note> occaſion of going into the other part of the City; ſo there are for their greater eaſe, at leaſt upon the great Canal 18 or 20 eſtabliſh'd Paſſages; that is, ſeveral Gondoliers always ready at a convenient place to Ferry over in their Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers the Paſſengers from one ſide to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for which they pay ſomething leſs than a half-peny of our Money.</p>
                     <p>There are many more of theſe Paſſages in thoſe quarters of the City, where for want of Bridges the circumference of going by Land would be too large. All the publick Gondoliers are oblig'd to ſerve ſuch as will make uſe of them at the rate of 15 d. their Money an hour, which does not exceed 5 of ours.</p>
                     <p>The Ferry <hi>Gondolo's,</hi> having but one Oar, the Paſſage is not leſs tedious, than inconvenient; for theſe brutiſh Gondoliers, are ſo unreaſonable when they happen upon a Stranger that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Language, and unacquainted with the Cuſtoms of the Town, to Treat him with the utmoſt incivilities, telling one another in ſuch occaſions, that they have met with a <hi>Polander,</hi> being then certain to inſiſt upon the double price of what they ought to have, pretending they muſt by theſe means reimburſe themſelves of thoſe conſiderable Sums which they are oblig'd to pay the Republick for the Liberty of the Ferry; that is for the permiſſion of keeping a Gondole to that purpoſe<hi>:</hi> Beſides they are oblig'd to anſwer thoſe extraordinary contributions which is laid upon their Company in all the urgent neceſſities of the Republick.</p>

                     <head>Of the Streets and Places.</head>
                     <p>LAnd is ſo precious at <hi>Venice,</hi> that it is not to be admir'd if all the Streets are ſo narrow, that thoſe of the moſt frequented, will ſcarcely permit two People to Walk together; which is the occaſion of frequent Joſtlings, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at the ſeveral Turnings, which are very numerous. Nevertheleſs being pav'd with Brick, the ſide uppermoſt, free of Coaches, Horſes, Carts and other Carriages, theſe conveniences of Walking are the more eaſie, and make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the ſtraitneſs of them.</p>
                     <p>The Pavement grows ſmooth, and becomes ſo unequally worn in the length of time, that the leaſt Rains make them extreamly ſlippery; but it is not the ſame upon the Keys, for here you go with leſs conſtraint, as not being enclos'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 2 Rows of Houſes, beſides theſe diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves into the Canals, are much cleaner, and drier than the Streets.</p>
                     <p>You ſee at <hi>Venice</hi> the ends of ſeveral Streets moderately large, as alſo a great many little Places or Squares, beſides thoſe that each Church hath before it, which are generally pretty large; as likewiſe ſeveral others of a more inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bigneſs. The want which they have at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> of freſh Water, did oblige ſuch as have built, to continue ſo many little Places or Squares, that they might have in the midſt of each a publick Ciſtern, which they improperly call Wells, as being only fill'd with Rain Water, convey'd to them in Stone Gutters from the tops of Houſes, by the means of little Pipes or Funnels, that are fix'd to all their Walls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:102922:19"/>
However, they do poſitively affirm, that there is ſpring Water in ſome of theſe Wells, which is not altogether improbable; for that yellow and ill ſmelling Clay, which upon their cleanſing is thrown out of thoſe places, may in ſome meaſure juſtifie their argument; beſides, Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhew us there may be Springs of freſh Water under ſuch Grounds, as are cover'd with ſalt Water.</p>
                     <p>Although the Water is not generally very good at <hi>Venice,</hi> yet ſome of theſe Wells afford that which is very good: But ſuch as are deſirous of better, have their Water brought them in Boats, for that purpoſe only, from the <hi>Brente,</hi> which they pour into thoſe Wells to purifie, where it afterwards becomes extraordinary healthful. All the Dyers are oblig'd to this Expence in Water, more eſpecially in delicate Tinctures, for that of the Canals is only proper for their firſt waſhings.</p>
                     <p>It is wonderful that the Water ſhould not be good at <hi>Padua,</hi> and almoſt throughout the whole Dominion of this State in <hi>Italy,</hi> but even much worſer than that of <hi>Venice:</hi> I imagine this to be partly the Reaſon of their mixing the Wines with a fourth, if not a third part Water, that ſo by the Fermentation of the Wine in the Veſſel at the time of the Vintage, the Water may the better incorporate, which alteration renders it abundantly more healthful. Beſides, I am of the opinion that the natural hardneſs of their common Wines which grow upon great Trees about <hi>Venice,</hi> as likewiſe in moiſt Bottoms, do's much more oblige them to follow this method; for their natural harſhneſs preſerves
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102922:20"/>
them a long time, although mix'd with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>I cannot forbear obſerving in this place the advantage the Country of <hi>Modena</hi> hath over her Neighbouring Provinces; for as that Province is very low of Scituation, you have the Water very bad when they only ſink to ſuch a certain depth, but up on paſſing that, they find a level of hard Stone, through which they muſt ſink, &amp; their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is not only rewarded with an excellent Water, but the Stone ſerves them inſtead of Bricks for the Work and mouth of the Well; to which the Water riſes in abundance. I remember one at the <hi>Capucins</hi> of <hi>Modena,</hi> which continually ran over, making a little Stream of moſt excellent Water.</p>

Upon that of the Right hand is ſeen the winged Lion of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> caſt in Braſs, on the other the Effigies of St. <hi>Theodorus</hi> firſt Patron of this City.</p>

                     <p>The firſt Place of St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſeems to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Three Parts, by the low'ring of the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Two little Water conveyances which ſeparate them from one another: When the Nobles meet in the Morning they make uſe of the Piazza, under the Palace of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> as alſo one Third Part of the Place on that ſide: When they go to the <hi>Broglio</hi> in the Afternoon, they have the Piazza of the firſt Wing of the New Procuratory, with the adjoyning part of the place; ſo that part which they frequent in the Forenoon is defended from the Morning Sun, as likewiſe that of the Afternoon from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Beams of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>While the Nobles are at the <hi>Broglio,</hi> Two Thirds of the Place of St. <hi>Mark</hi> remains free to ſuch whoſe Buſineſs calls them thither, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe brought out of Curioſity, who are equally oblig'd not to mingle with the Nobility, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into that ſpace which they at thoſe times

Nevertheleſs, they do not immediately acquaint a Stranger with his inadvertency, that does unknowingly either croſs, or ſtand ſome time upon the <hi>Broglio,</hi> much leſs occaſion him to be detained, as many imagine.</p>
                     <p>It is not one of the leaſt Curioſities of <hi>Venice,</hi> to ſee in the Morning early of the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Seaſon, a great number of the Noble <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> even from the moſt elevated Dignities of the Republick, to the moſt inferior Particulars of that Body, Walking and Diſcourſing there, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting each other with the profoundeſt Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Reſpect; but much more to behold the Chiefeſt Senators Brigue the Suffrages of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Nobility, which they do with all the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary demonſtration of Civility: although the Government doth ſtrictly forbid ſuch indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Practices, and forming of Parties, unleſs it be in criminal Matters; yet the <hi>Broglio</hi> may be ſaid to be the real Market of the publick Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this State.</p>
                     <p>The common uſe of theſe Sollicitations at the <hi>Broglio,</hi> do ſo well accuſtom the <hi>Venetian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to Civility, and Compliment, that it is by none ſo well underſtood, as by thoſe of this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Thoſe ſeveral Humiliations are ſo neceſſary, that when a Petitioner hapneth not to make them profound enough to their Fancy, they ſay he is <hi>Duro di Schina,</hi> or, <hi>That he hath a ſtake in his Back,</hi> for which reaſon he is oftentimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd

                     <p>Which hapned not many years paſt to the young <hi>Mocenigo,</hi> who made it his buſineſs to be re-admitted into the Body of the Nobility, from which he was expelled by an irrevocable Act, ſentencing him to death for aſſaſſinating one <hi>Foſcarini</hi> in a Box at the Play-houſe; but as they never proceed to the execution of theſe Sentences upon the Nobility, unleſs it be in things that concern the State, ſo his Pardon paſs'd the Great Council at the Second Balo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>

But the Morning is chiefly for the Men of Buſineſs, and ſuch of the Lawyers as are oblig'd to attend the Palace.

                     <p>Among the many Diverſions, and the ſeveral Gentlemen of Induſtry upon this Place, none are ſo ridiculous as the Fortune-tellers, who by an attentive obſervation of the Face, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Lines of the Hand, taking their proportions and diſtances, which they meaſure with Compaſſes upon the Globe, perſuading the ſilly People that they are perfectly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

                     <p>THe Palace of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is a large ſquare Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one of the two principal Fronts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of looks towards the Sea; the other upon the firſt Place, as hath been already ſaid. They are both Adorn'd with Two Porches one above the other, whoſe Pillars and open Arches are of common Marble, but of an order of Architect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, not leſs Rich than Ancient. The Walls are quite plain, but divers Red, like ſome ſort of painted Brick, and diſpos'd into ſeveral large Quarrels of various colours, even to the very Pinnacles, which are entire of Free-Stone, and variouſly Figured.</p>
                     <p>The Roof is of Lead, but very low, yet when this Building is exactly conſidered, the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the Republick is apparent in all its parts. The Third Front of the Palace being oppoſite to that which regards the Place, is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a little Canal, to which you come by <hi>Gondole.</hi> This part is of a more modern Architecture, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102922:23"/>
from the ſurface of the Water, for about Twelve Foot high, it is cut in Diamond-ſquare. You go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by ſix large Doors, whoſe Steps are covered with Water, the reſt of the Front which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary height and length, with long Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conies on the Firſt and Second Floors, is of common Marble, embelliſhed with ſeveral fine Works <hi>Bas Relief,</hi> and ſo well built, that this part of the Palace ſeems to be of one entire Stone.</p>
                     <p>The Principal Gate of the Palace, is in that corner of the Place which comes to the Church of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> it is a very Ancient piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, embelliſh'd with many Figures; the entrance is through a long Porch, which on the Right Hand hath a communication with the Court; That of the Left with the Church of St. <hi>Mark:</hi> The extremity of the Entrance on this ſide, ends at the foot of an open Stair-Caſe. The Court is reaſonably large, the three parts of the Houſe are the three ſides that have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken of, and the Piazza or Gallery at the entrance, ſupports one Story Magnificently Built, and contiguous to the Church, which makes the Fourth.</p>
                     <p>Round about the Court ranges a very large Gallery, whoſe Pillars are of Marble, cut in Panes, and deep Pannels, ſupporting another Gallery which is in the Firſt Story, even to that without, which looks upon the Place; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing equalizes the Beauty of the Front of that part of the Palace, which you ſee coming in from the Place, anſwering to that upon the Canal. This Building is not ſo Ancient as the reſt of the Palace, but ſeemeth to have been built in the moſt flouriſhing Days of the Republick;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102922:24"/>
the whole height which is above the Second Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, being Adorn'd with Demi-Pillars, Feſloons, <hi>Arabian</hi> Work, and other pieces in <hi>Bas relief,</hi> all which are in Marble of an extraordinary Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>What is moſt remarkably fine in the Court of the Palace, both for the Marble and the Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the Front of the Gallery, by which you enter; for here are ſeveral very fine Antick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures: but the <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> at the Gate of this Gallery which is oppoſite to the Stairs, are Two excellent Figures. The Stairs are of Marble of one Range, and open, conducting you to the Gallery of the firſt Story, terminated by Two Noble <hi>Coloſſus's</hi> of <hi>Sauſouin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the firſt Story of the Palace there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great number of Rooms, that look both upon the Court and Place, being even with the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries on both ſides, which are frequented for the Aſſemblies of as many different Magiſtrates and Officers of Juſtice. A moſt Magnificent pair of Stairs that begins at the Second Story in the middle of that part in the Center, leaves you at the firſt Landing-place on the Left Hand at the Appartments of the Doge; and the next Aſcent brings you to the Hall of the College, the Pregadi, Scrutiny, and Council of Ten; as likewiſe to the Inquiſitors of the State, to the Great Hall of the Great Council: In ſhort, by a Labyrinth of Communications you paſs through all the Rooms of the Palace, from whence you deſcend another great pair of Stairs not very far from the firſt.</p>

Here you ſee in all theſe places, great variety of Wainſcoting, and Roofs richly Gilt and Painted: The Walls are covered, inſtead of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry, with noble pieces of excellent Paintings, purpoſely deſign'd for theſe places; The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Maſters of the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> School, as <hi>Georgeon, Titien, Paul Veroneſe, Palme, Tintore,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, have endeavoured to exceed each other in the ſeveral Maſter-pieces of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: But according to my Opinion the moſt admirable of all theſe, is the Paradiſe of <hi>Tintore</hi> in the Great Hall of the Great Council, where you may count above a Thouſand Figures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably better finiſhed then any of his other Works, and which by an admirable diverſity, without confuſion, plainly ſhew you the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Genius of this Painter.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only touch at theſe things <hi>en paſſant,</hi> to the end it may be ſeen by the Inſtances of theſe excellent Works, and mighty Buildings, what the Greatneſs of this Republick hath been, more eſpecially in the Third and Fourth Ages, in which time they could go by Land through their own Dominions, from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> The Doge then joining to his other Titles, that of King of <hi>Candia</hi> and <hi>Negropont,</hi> as likewiſe Lord of half the City, and a Fourth part of the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

                        <hi>Of the Church of St.</hi> Mark.</head>
                     <p>ST. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church is the place where all the Solemn Ceremonies are performed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Chappel of the Doge: This is a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate Church, without having any Juriſdiction
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102922:25"/>
abroad; it depends entirely on the Doge, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he makes the Preſentation where he thinks fit, which Perſon is likewiſe Dean of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, officiating with Mitre and Croſs, with all other Epiſcopal Functions. For which reaſon this Preferment is always conferr'd upon a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Venetian,</hi> whoſe Revenue is about Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducats, beſides an Abby that commonly goes with it: This Prelate hath Six and twenty Canons under him, who are all of the Doge's nomination. Beſides theſe, there is a Seminary of young Men that are deſigned to the Service of this Church.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Principal Solemnities of the Year, eſpecially in the Holy Week, they follow the <hi>Rituals</hi> of the Church of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Ancient Tradition the Body of St. <hi>Mark</hi> was brought from thence, which hath given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to this Cuſtom ever ſince, in obſerving ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particular Ceremonies. The moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is the Proceſſion of the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> which is carried in great Solemnity upon <hi>Good Friday</hi> at Nine in the Evening round about the Place in a Coffin covered with Black Velvet. The Popes were never able to aboliſh this Cuſtom; it was formerly practis'd throughout the whole State, but the Republick have limited the uſe of it now to the Churches of this City only; all which at that time, make the like Proceſſion within the diſtricts of their ſeveral Pariſhes.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more Glorious than <hi>Venice</hi> upon this Night, which is illuminated with Millions of Flambeaux, the Place of St. <hi>Mark</hi> being then one of the fineſt Sights imaginable; for there are two great Flambeau's or Tapors of white Wax
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102922:25"/>
at each Window of the Procuratory's, that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the Great Place: This double row of Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaus regularly placed, with thoſe upon the <hi>Church Gate,</hi> have together a very noble Effect, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating all the Proceſſions of the Confraternity, and neighbouring Pariſhes, that purpoſely come into the Great Place.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Proceſſions you ſee ſeveral Penitents diſguiſed with Caps of Two Foot high upon their Heads, who as they march juſt behind the Croſs, do ſo ſeverely laſh themſelves, that the Blood follows every ſtroke. They have for this purpoſe a Diſcipline of ſeveral ſtrings of knotted Whipcord, which they hold between their two Hands, and dipping of it in a pot of Vinegar, for that uſe carried by them, they whip themſelves ſo exactly, and in ſuch a cadence, that they muſt neceſſarily have ſtudied the Art to acquit themſelves of it as they do. In the mean time the whole City ſeems to be on fire, by the great numbers of Proceſſions, where the white Wax is ſo little ſpar'd, that one would almoſt imagine they conſume as much there upon this occaſion, as might ſerve all <hi>Italy</hi> a Twelve Month.</p>
                     <p>The Church of St. <hi>Mark</hi> hath another parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular privilege, which is to perform the Office of the Maſs at ſix in the Evening upon <hi>Chriſtmas-Eve.</hi> They begin the Office at the <hi>24th.</hi> Hour. Two Hours afterwards they ſing Maſs with four Quires of Muſick, in much Solemnity, and a mighty concourſe of People. The diſorders and ſcandals that were us'd to happen at this Solemnity, when perform'd at Midnight, was the occaſion of the permiſſion which this Church hath to celebrate that Office at Six.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:102922:26"/>
The Architecture of this Church is Antick, Solid and Maſſive, with Five very low Domes covered with Lead, a row of ſmall Windows ranging above the Corniſh; the two ſides of the Church are a ſort of an inclos'd Gallery, and ſeparated from the reſt; There is in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Front of the Church five great Doors, Adorn'd with an abundance of Porphyr Pillars, and ſeveral other ſorts of fine Marble; Above the Moulding of the Door there is a Caridor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with ſolid Balluſters, that reach from one end, of the Front to the other: in which place upon the four great Pedeſtals above the great Door, are placed four noble Horſes of Braſs, no where to be match'd in Beauty; theſe together with the Painting after the <hi>Moſaique</hi> manner, which reaching from the Moulding of the Doors to the higheſt part of this Building, compleats the rich Embelliſhments of the Gate of St. <hi>Mark.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Beauty and Antiquity of theſe Horſes have occaſioned the Curious to make a ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into them; and it is believed that theſe are the Horſes which when <hi>Nero</hi> triumph'd over the <hi>Parthians,</hi> were given to him to be put to the Chariot of the Sun, upon the Triumphal Arch, then conſecrated to him at <hi>Rome;</hi> as may be ſeen engraven upon the Reverſe of ſome Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of this Emperor; <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great ſent them to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and plac'd them in the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> or as others will have it, upon the Gate of <hi>Sancta Sophia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Venetians,</hi> joined by the Naval For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>French</hi> Princes, took the City of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Marin Zen,</hi> who was the firſt <hi>Podeſtal</hi> or Governor that the Republick ſent thither to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102922:26"/>
Command in that part of the Conqueſt which belonged to them, was the Perſon who ſent theſe Horſes to <hi>Venice,</hi> where they were kept a conſiderable time before their Value and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were diſcovered, but afterward placed upon the Gate of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church.</p>
                     <p>This Church is built in the form of a Croſs, without any ornaments of Architecture within; the Walls, as likewiſe the Great Pillars that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Body of the Church, are of a Grey Marble, ſtreak'd with Black, which great pieces are ſo curiouſly inlay'd, and ſo rarely ordered, that one would imagin it to be the Work of ſome extraordinary Pencil; From the opening of the loweſt Arches even to the Vaults and Domes, all is covered with Ancient and Modern Moſaick Work, upon a Ground of Gold: you ſee in many places, very noble pieces of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the moſt Famous Hands; the Great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the incloſure of the Quire, the Three Doors within the Porch, are all of the fineſt Marble: in ſhort, here is nothing that is not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Rich and Noble.</p>
                     <p>To avoid being tedious, I will not enter into the deſcription of particulars, it will be ſufficient to obſerve in general, the Marble, the Pillars, the large Tables of Gold and Silver ſet with the richeſt Stones, both in the Front and Tables of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; The Riches expos'd upon Solemn occaſions; the Pavement of the Church, part Grotick, part in diviſions of Inlayed or parketted Marble of ſeveral Colours and Figures; as alſo the great Doors of Braſs, wrought through, and curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Adorn'd with rais'd Work, as they were when brought from <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> hither; the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102922:27"/>
bare reflection upon all theſe things will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently make it appear, that the Republick could not have any thing leſs than the Spoils of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> to acquire this mighty Collection of ineſtimable things.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Treaſure of</hi> Venice.</head>
                     <p>VVHat is commonly call'd the Treaſure of <hi>Venice,</hi> is but in effect the Treaſure of St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Church, which is yet divided into two parts; One properly belonging to the Treaſure of the Church, and the other to that of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. The Reliques compoſe the firſt part; a vaſt quantity of Jewels, as likewiſe of Plate, Veſſels and Crowns make the other; all which are very carefully kept in the Church, as a moſt ſacred Depoſitory; whoſe Keys are committed to the Cuſtody of a Procuratour of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> a Dignity that is by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the higeſt Rank, as it will appear in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>There is to be ſeen among the Reliques of all that Religion eſteemeth moſt Sacred, a great number of Gold and Silver Shrines, <hi>viz.</hi> of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Veſſels for the uſe of the Altar: But of all the Reliques which the People and the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick moſt eſteem and honour, is the precious Blood that is kept in an Ampoule or Cruet, which with moſt particular Ceremonies, is three or four times a Year expos'd to the publick view, by reaſon of the frequent Miracles they pretend do happen upon theſe Expoſitions, by Curing many poſſeſs'd People, which they bring hither from other places againſt theſe Solemnities, in a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102922:27"/>
prodigious concourſe of People and Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>They have in the Treaſure no other Reliques of St. <hi>Mark</hi> than that of his Thumb, which they ſay he cut off, becauſe he would not enter into the holy Order of Prieſthood, as thinking himſelf unworthy of it; and the Goſpel which they pretend is the the true Original, and of his own hand writing; but they only ſhew, the rich Shrine in which they ſay it is inclos'd. But ſince the Tradition of the Country will have it, that his whole Body was brought hither, it is very ſurprizing that they ſhould have no more of the Reliques; yet the reaſons given for it, are too ſingular to be paſs'd over in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>In the Year 827, under the Doge <hi>Juſtiniani Participate Badociarius,</hi> certain <hi>Grecian</hi> Prieſts that ſerv'd a Chappel near <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in which lay the Body of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> were ſo enrag'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Mahometans who poſſeſs'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for demoliſhing this holy Structure, upon the account of building other places with the Materials; that they yielded to the preſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of 2 <hi>Venetian</hi> Merchants, and deliver'd to them this holy Relique, which they convey'd to <hi>Venice:</hi> The Doge and People receiv'd the Body of St. <hi>Mark</hi> with an expreſſible Joy and Devotion. They made him the Protector of this City and Republick, and rais'd in honour of him this Church, which being almoſt quite conſum'd by fire, was rebuilt more Magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than ever, and afterwards enrich'd with the Spoils of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Conqueſts in the <hi>Levant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The devotion which the People and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick at firſt conceiv'd for their new Patron,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102922:28"/>
did apparently diminiſh; for about 270 Years after the Tranſlation of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> there was no body that either knew, or had heard where the Body of the holy Evangeliſt was placed; upon which the People and the Republick made their recourſe to God Almighty, with their general Prayers and a Three days rigorous Faſt, and being aſſembl'd in the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him with Tears, to ſignifie unto them whereabouts his Body was, and they beheld as it is ſaid, one of the Pillars of the Church to open, from whence came an Arm of the Saint with a Ring upon the Finger.</p>
                     <p>All the Prelates and Principal Nobles then preſent, there reiterated upon this Miracle, the the fervency of their Prayers to the bleſſed Saint, beſeeching him to beſtow upon them the Ring he had upon his Finger, in teſtimony that his Body lay within that Cheſt, which appear'd in the middle of the Pillar, from whence his Arm came; but as there being no likelihood of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this favour, the Noble <hi>Dominique Delphin</hi> out of much zeal and confidence approach'd the Arm, and kiſſing the hand of the Saint, he receiv'd this precious Relique: The Arm return'd into the Cheſt, the Pillar clos'd and the Ring was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards loſt, through a great number of various accidents, as may be ſeen at large in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In memory of this famous Miracle, of the apparition of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> they have continu'd it as a Holy-day ever ſince, keeping it every Year with much Solemnity: Yet no body knows which is the Pillar that open'd and ſhut again. However the People are ſatisfi'd the knowledge
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102922:28"/>
of it is reſerv'd to the Doge, the Procuratour of the Treaſure, the Dean of the Chappel and ſome other Officers of the Church, but that they are oblig'd by Oath never to reveal the Secret to any others.</p>
                     <p>In a place adjoining to that where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques are kept, they ſhew you the riches of their Treaſure, plac'd upon the ſhelves of a great Preſs cover'd over with black Velvet, for the more advantageous appearing of them. The Procurator with the Keys ſtands within a row of Baliſters, which is at ſuch a diſtance that one cannot reach them with their Hands. The moſt remarkable things of this Treaſure, are 12 golden Corſlets, made like ſmall breaſt-Pieces, ſet over with very large Pearls, and an infinite number of rich Stones of different Seizes, as likwiſe 12 Crowns of beaten Gold, of the ſame workmanſhip, with the Corſlets, which do not weigh leſs then if they were for common uſe of Iron, and Musket proof.</p>
                     <p>They ſay that 12 Ladies of Honour of the Empreſs of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> were us'd upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Occaſions to carry theſe rich Ornaments on their Heads, but at preſent they are only us'd to adorn the ſteps to the Altar, when the other riches of the Treaſury are expos'd upon any great Feſtival. There are likewiſe ſix great Rubies, although they are not cut, yet they make an extraordinary ſhew, they are not ſet, but run upon a gold Wyre that paſſes through them: it is affirm'd that the largeſt weighs ſix Ounces.</p>
                     <p>The Ducal Horn or Cap, being the Crown that is worn by the Doge, in the Ceremony of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102922:29"/>
Coronation, is in my opinion the richeſt thing in the Treaſury. It is a Cap of Crimſon Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, the back part being ſomething rais'd in a round point, hath occaſion'd to it that Name: The lower part of the Front is enclos'd by a Plate of Gold about 2 Fingers broad, which with the croſs pieces that encloſeth it at top, are cover'd with Stones of an extraordinary value; as likewiſe the 4 Angles within the croſs'd Bars; at the point or extremity of it, there is ſet a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine Diamond, indifferently large, but very high; which was preſented to the Republick by <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> at his return form <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Yet all theſe rich Stones are mightily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a row of very large Pearls, that are hung round the Front of the Crown; their beauty and greatneſs do undiſputably render this both the fineſt and the richeſt piece of all the Treaſury.</p>
                     <p>There is a much admir'd Cup, which is cut out of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Stone, that exceeds in greatneſs an ordinary ſilver Porringer, the outſide foliage of the Stone is wrought into a foliage of Vines, both large and deep. There is likewiſe a little Paile of one ſingle Ruby, which is bigger than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ewer; if I had not ſeen an expert <hi>French</hi> Jeweller examine them in his Hands, aſſuring them to be really what they are ſaid to be, I ſhould have had ſome difficulty to have believ'd them right.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, there are in the Treaſury an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of rich things, Croſſes ſet with Pearls and Diamonds; great pieces of Plate, Scepters of great value, an abundance of Agat and Cornelian Veſſels of ſeveral Figures, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102922:29"/>
ſeveral other pieces in rare tranſparent Stone, of one price, as alſo very large, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in number to make out an intire Service; which evidently ſhews what hath been the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the greateſt part of theſe rarities being the fragments of that Court, brought hither by the <hi>Venetians</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>The Treaſury had formerly many other things not much Inferiour in value to theſe, as a golden Chain of ſuch an extraordinary length and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that 40 Porters were employ'd to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of it, as likewiſe 12 or 15 Millions of coin'd Gold, which was only kept to ſhew the People and Strangers their great riches upon days of Solemnity, the Chain being hung along the <hi>Piazza</hi> of the Palace upon St. <hi>Mark's</hi> place, with a Cup of Gold between each 2 Pillars; the Republick were us'd to add every Year ſome new Links to it<hi>:</hi> But the War of <hi>Candy</hi> ſwept away this Treaſure, and the Chain became Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins in the preſſing neceſſities of the State, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which, ſeveral Noble Families found the means of turning the misfortunes of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to their own private advantages, which are to this day poſſeſs'd by their Poſterity.</p>

                     <p>The greateſt part of the Pariſh Churches are ſmall, neither are they the richeſt or beſt adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; thoſe of the Convents, both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are the moſt handſome and neat; but ſome of the great Confraternities are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more magnificently Built and better Furniſh'd both with Pictures and noble Services of Plate<hi>:</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> having a greater Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to theſe particular Devotions, than for their Pariſh Churches, which do not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them. Yet nevertheleſs, there is not that Church in <hi>Venice,</hi> in which there is not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remarkable, either for Painting or Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture.</p>

Thoſe who are well acquainted with <hi>Venice,</hi> are of the opinion, that ſhe hath near upon as many excellent pieces of Painting as all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>Italy</hi> together; for not only the major part of the Nobles Houſes, but likewiſe other particulars are fill'd with the choiceſt pieces, yet much more the Churches and other publick Places, whoſe Walls and Ceilings are cover'd with the the beſt Drawings of the greateſt Maſters. The School or Confraternity of St. <hi>Roch</hi> hath the precedency for Riches, beauty of Architecture, and for the extraordinary number of <hi>Tintoret's</hi> Works. That of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is not much inferior, the Front being in <hi>Baſſe relief</hi> of extraordinary <hi>Marble,</hi> and the inſide wholly painted by the hand of the ſame Maſter, which hath produc'd ſo vaſt a quantity of extraordinary Works, that the life of another Painter would not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to execute what he did in two Years, only at the Church of St. <hi>Roch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Church of St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> is admirable, both for its beauty and great number of pieces by <hi>Paul Veroneſe,</hi> who lies there Interr'd. That of St. <hi>Mary</hi> Major hath divers Works of <hi>Baſſan,</hi> extreamly fine; but among all the modern Churches for Architecture, that of our Lady <hi>Delta Salute</hi> muſt be reckon'd in the firſt place when finiſhed; it was built upon the occaſion of a Vow the Republick made in hopes of being deliver'd from a great Plague, the deſign is particular, and its ſcituation admirable, being at the entrance of the great Canal.</p>
                     <p>It is a great Octagonal that incloſeth one not ſo large, whoſe eight Pillars at the Angles, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a very handſom Cupola. The great Altar
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102922:34"/>
is at the lower end of a great Oval, inrich'd with ſeveral curious Figures of white Marble, which repreſent the driving away of that raging Sickneſs, by the zeal and piety of the Republick; there are ſix more Chappels, in the other ſix ſides of the Octagone, with Altars and Balluſters of Marble; the Porch and outſide of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not much leſs adorn'd than the Inſide.</p>
                     <p>The Church and Convent of St, <hi>George</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, that ſolely poſſeſſeth a little Iſland over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Place of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> at the diſtance only of a Musket ſhot, are moſt noble buildings; here is that admirable piece of the Marriage of <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> it wholly takes up the end of the Refactory; and is eſteem'd for the Maſter-piece of <hi>Paul Veroneſe.</hi> This Abby is of the Order of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> the Garden is the moſt agreeable Spot of <hi>Venice,</hi> it is encompaſs'd with Terraſs Walks rais'd like Ramparts, from whence you behold whatſoever is worthy of obſervation in the <hi>Lagunes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Convent of St. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in the City, is remakable for the fine Dormitory; the Church is one of the largeſt; but the Piece of St <hi>Peter</hi> the Martyr done by <hi>Titian's</hi> Hand, is its fineſt Ornament, it was both the Maſter-piece of that great Painter, and one of the four fineſt in the World; but is at preſent ſo much abuſed, that it is in danger of being quite gone in 20 Years more; it being not only kept in a bad place, but likewiſe the Painters that are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally copying of it, have already paſſed their ſponges ſo often upon the Face of the Saint, that the colour is in a manner quite extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, notwithſtanding all the care that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102922:35"/>
to prevent the Copyers from approaching it too nigh, as likewiſe to prevent their working but upon particular leave.</p>
                     <p>There are at <hi>Venice</hi> ſeveral ſmall Churches of an uncommon and particular agreeableneſs, built by the Architects <hi>Sanſouin</hi> and <hi>Du Palcadio,</hi> the laſt of theſe never did any thing comparable to the Church of our Saviour at <hi>La Zueca,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much like to that of our Lady <hi>De La Salute,</hi> and the effect of a Vow made by the Republick; as it was deſign'd for the Capuchins who would not accept it in that magnificence it was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; ſo one muſt allow that <hi>Du Palladio</hi> hath dexterouſly deceiv'd their Eyes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a more than ordinary beauty to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of this Structure, by building it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the moſt exact rules of Art and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, rather than by the moſt oſtentary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations of Artichecture, which may neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be there in ſome meaſure admir'd; the Roof is plain and even, vaulted, but thought to be too much declin'd.</p>
                     <p>It would be very tedious to enter into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of all things of this Nature at <hi>Venice,</hi> I ſhall content my ſelf with mentioning only the great number of <hi>Mauſoleum's</hi> that are in their Churches; they being Erected to the Memory of almoſt all their Doge's and principal Senatoss: The <hi>Venetians</hi> having been ever very careful in raiſing noble Monuments to the Virtue and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their great Men; by which means <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> abounds with a mighty number of fine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sepulchres; amongſt which the magnificence of that for the laſt Doge <hi>Paſaro,</hi> at the <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier's</hi> is much Eſteem'd, as likewiſe that of their

                     <p>THeſe two places are the Richeſt in <hi>Venice,</hi> beſt Peopled, and the moſt agreeable to the Eye, next to the Place of St <hi>Mark,</hi> all that part from the Place to the Bridge of <hi>Rialto,</hi> is call'd the <hi>Mercury,</hi> which are 5 or 6 narrow Streets in Length, where are expos'd to Sale all ſorts of rich Silks, Stuffs, Tiſſue's of Gold, Points <hi>de Veniſe,</hi> Rubans, Silver and Gold Lace, Velvets, Damasks and Brocards of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary price; which being mixed with many other ſorts of Merchandizes, makes this one of the moſt agreeable parts of all <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The little Place of St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> that joins the <hi>Mercury</hi> to the Bridge of <hi>Rialto,</hi> is intirely Inhabited by the Druggiſts; where you find all the Commodities that come out of the <hi>Levant</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> the Livelineſs of theſe places, with the continual concourſe of People, do render them altogether as agreeable as the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> or even the Galleries of the Exchange or Palace.</p>
                     <p>The Quarter of the <hi>Rialto</hi> is the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Part of the City, for here they laid the firſt Foundation of it; it is one entire and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Iſland, being apart from the Mercery on the other ſide of the Bridge; at the bottom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, on the left hand, is a long Gallery with Shops of Draperies, and other ſorts of Stuffs; the Ware-houſes are over head, and on the right is the Place of <hi>Rialto,</hi> in which the little Church
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102922:36"/>
of St. <hi>James,</hi> being the ancienteſt of this City, and built above 1200 Years ſince, makes one of the Sides near the Bridge; the other two is an <hi>Acrade,</hi> under which the Merchants meet about their Affairs of Commerce: Behind the Church of St. <hi>James,</hi> on the ſide of the great Canal, you behold a very ancient Building, and for the moſt part of Marble, under which are moſt diſmal Priſons; it was formerly the Palace or Court of Juſtice for the whole City, they yet continue it the Aſſeſſions-houſe of ſeveral Magiſtrates, for Cauſes both Civil and Criminal, appertaining to the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Rialto.</hi>

                     <p>THere is nothing ſo famous as the <hi>Arſenal</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> nor any thing that does ſo much demonſtrate the Power of this Republick; it is the Object of all Strangers Admiration, and the Foundation of the Strength of the State: The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> values it ſo much, as (by Report) to prefer it to whatever elſe the State poſſeſſeth. It
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102922:36"/>
is of a large Circumference, being more than 2 Miles about, taking up all the Eaſtern Diviſion of the City, from which it is only ſeparated by a ſmall Canal that waſhes three ſides of it, and the <hi>Lagunes</hi> the fourth, that lies towards the North; it is incloſed with very high Walls and Towers at certain Diſtances, where is kept a very exact Guard, eſpecially in the Night; the Centinels can, by little Bells in thoſe Towers, advertiſe the <hi>Corps du Guard</hi> in caſe of Attempts, and other Accidents of Fire that may caſually happen, or premeditately break forth upon the Inſtigations of any ſecret Enemy.</p>
                     <p>It was the firſt thing that was to have been executed in the Conſpiracy of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Year 1618, whilſt the other Confederates attack'd the Body of the Nobility in the Palace of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> but Heaven prevented the Blow by the means of two <hi>French</hi> Men that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome Hints of their Deſign, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took Poſt to inform the Senate of their Danger: The <hi>Arſenal</hi> is ſo important to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, that there is not any thing which gives them ſo much occaſion of Care and Diſtruſt; for not only the ſecurity of the City and State, but likewiſe the greateſt part of this Republick's Power depends upon it.</p>
                     <p>It would take up a whole Volume to deſcribe all that is remarkable in the <hi>Arſenal;</hi> therefore I ſhall let it ſuffice to obſerve in general, That there are in the ſeveral Apartments a moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing quantity of Arms both for Horſe and Foot, as likewiſe for the Ships and Gallies, all very neat, and kept in an extraordinary order; you ſee in one Room the neceſſary Arms for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102922:37"/>
10000 Men; in another for 20000, even to a third and fourth for 30 or 40000 each.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Care is here obſerved in reference of the Naval Stores; for in one Room there are the Neceſſaries for 20 Gallies, another 30, and a fourth of 40: On one hand you ſee all ſorts of Arms for 40 Ships; on the other for 10 Galeaſſes. In ſhort, it's almoſt impoſſible to imagine what a prodigious quantity of Arms there is in theſe Magazines.</p>
                     <p>The Republick entertained <hi>Henry</hi> the Third in great State when he viſited the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> where the Pleaſure they gave him in ſeeing a Galley fitted up and rigg'd out while he was at Dinner, was not the leaſt Satisfaction they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented His Majeſty with during the time he ſtayed at <hi>Venice.</hi> Under theſe Rooms there are ſeveral diſtinct Store-houſes for all ſorts of Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Military Equipage: It is reckoned there are above 800 Pieces of Cannon for the Service of Sea and Land; of Bullets, Bombs, Granades and Mortars a proportionable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and even the ſame of Collars for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery-Horſes.</p>
                     <p>The Maſts, Yards, Oars, Pulleys, Sails, Ropes, Anchors, Nails, and all ſort of Iron-work neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the building of Ships, are here kept in their ſeparate and diſtinct Places; inſomuch that whatſoever is neceſſary for any Expedition of either Sea or Land, may be ſeen in the greateſt abundance. Without doubt they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a condition of fitting out a Hundred Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies or Galeaſſes, and as able to Arm a Hundred thouſand Men; which would be more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to allarm the greateſt Potentates of <hi>Europe,</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:102922:37"/>
if Men and Money were equally anſwerable to theſe mighty Stores.</p>
                     <p>There are in the <hi>Arſenal</hi> Three very large wet Docks, which are ſupplied with Water by the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> round which are a great many Houſes large enough to contain Two Veſſels, and keep them from the injuries of the Weather; here they refit and build their Veſſels, Gallies and Galleaſſes, which are not Launch'd until they deſign to uſe them: Theſe places are not only full of whatſoever is neceſſary for preſent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but likewiſe of the remainders of their victorious Armies, and the many Prizes they have taken from the Turks, in thoſe ſignal Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories they have frequently obtain'd both by Sea and Land.</p>
                     <p>By theſe mighty Stores, the Republick is ever able to fit out in a very ſmall time a Fleet of Forty Gallies, and as many Galleaſſes; of Nine or Ten that are in the Docks, there is one of an extraordinary largeneſs, but not yet finiſh'd. This ſort of Veſſels are equal to the largeſt Ships in Length and Breadth, their Compliment conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinarily of 1000 or 1200 Men; inſomuch that theſe Galleaſſes may be truly termed floating Caſtles, they having in a Calm all the advantages of the ſmalleſt Gallies; for which reaſon as the gaining of the Day uſually depends upon theſe Galleaſſes, ſo they can only be Commanded by Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> which Commanders are yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd by Oath, and to anſwer it at the price of their Heads, not to refuſe Engaging againſt Twenty five Gallies of the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever is made in the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> is of a Nature ſo Sacred to all manner of People, as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102922:38"/>
to admit of no Clemency upon the Embezel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; all things have there the Impreſſion of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> even to the very Nails; and if any Perſon ſhould be found with the leaſt of thoſe things, he would be immediately and without Redemption condemn'd to the Gallies. The Cordage and Cables of <hi>Venice</hi> are famous for their goodneſs, inſomuch that all others, are no ways to be compar'd with them: Yet I am very much of the opinion that their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Twining doth not contribute leſs to it, than the excellency of their Hemp.</p>
                     <p>They practiſe here the direct contrary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to what they do in other Countries; for he that turns, goes backward with a Wooden Wheel faſtned to his Girdle, and he that twiſts it is ſitting, ſo Working at his eaſe, he muſt undoubtedly make a rounder and better wrought Ware, of which abſolutely depends the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Cord. The Ropery is the beſt of any I ever ſaw, it is cover'd, and of a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Length; the Breadth is divided into 3 rows of Pillars, that ſuſtain each a Penthouſe of Wood, which ſerve as 2 mighty Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines for the Hemp all the Country is oblig'd to deliver here, at a rate prefix'd by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</p>
                     <p>The Veſſels that are built in the <hi>Arſenal</hi> are of a particular goodneſs, eſpecially the Gallies, not only by reaſon of their Symmetry and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Proportions, that render them very nimble at Sea, as being leſs than thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> but for their extraordinary goodneſs, which makes them laſt thrice as long as any built in other Places. The Ingenuity of the <hi>Arſenal</hi> Builders
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102922:38"/>
gives them the advantage of the firſt; but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Timber they Imploy in the building of them, is the principal reaſon of their long continuance.</p>
                     <p>The excellency of the Wood they uſe, is chiefly occaſioned by the great care they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in ſeaſoning of it; for no Timber is wrought in the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> that hath not been at leaſt Ten Years in Salt Water, at the bottom of the wet Docks mentioned, where there is always a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity to ſupply the moſt extraordinary occaſions of the Republick; each piece being mark'd with the Day, and Date, when it was put into the Water, where it ſo well ſettles and hardens after it comes to the Air, that it is never after ſubject either to fret or fly in the working or uſing.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arſenal</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> is Governed as if it were a little ſeparate Republick of it ſelf; they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an extraordinary exact Guard at the Gate; the work People directed by Surveyors, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually making all ſorts of things, that appertain unto the Naval Stores; who are yet only Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Three Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> that reſide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the <hi>Arſenal:</hi> theſe are chang'd at the expiration of Three Years, contrary to the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cuſtom of the Republick, that hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the expiring of almoſt all other Employs at the term of Sixteen Months; but this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar regard is obſerv'd here, leſt the frequent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the Proveditors of the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> might not occaſion ſome impediment to thoſe many and various works, which neceſſary knowledge is not attainable in a ſmall ſpace of time.</p>
                     <p>All the Workmen are immediately ſubject to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102922:39"/>
a Director General of the Works, whom they call the great Admiral: He wears a Robe of Red Sattin, with a Veſt down to the knees; his Cap is of a Violet Damask, with a great Gold Band about it; he is nevertheleſs no more than an able Workman, who oweth only to his great proficiency the Intendancy of all that is made in the <hi>Arſenal.</hi> The moſt illuſtrious of all his Functions is the conduct of the <hi>Bucentaure,</hi> when the Doge, accompanied with the Ambaſſadours and Senate, ſolemnly goes upon <hi>Aſcenſion-day</hi> to eſpouſe the Sea.</p>
                     <p>This Officer is the Pilot of that magnificent Veſſel, and the Men that work her, are the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans of the <hi>Arſenal:</hi> As the Republick hath no Subjects more truly affectionate to them than theſe, ſo they confide the more eaſily in them; for the Admiral by an Ancient and particular Cuſtom, obliges himſelf at the price of his Head to bring back the <hi>Bucentaure,</hi> without ever run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any hazard of being overtaken by a Storm; for which reaſon at the leaſt appearance of an unſettl'd Day, he never goes far beyond the Mouth of the <hi>Lido,</hi> or rather defers the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to a more proper opportunity.</p>
                     <p>There is in the <hi>Arſenal</hi> alſo an Intendant of the Military Engines and Forges, as likewiſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mechanical Inventions, either uſeful in War, or to the ſcowring of the <hi>Lagunes;</hi> they are ever finding out ſome new Inventions of theſe kinds, which are referr'd to the examination of this Perſon. He is an able Mathematician, and hath ſeveral Models not leſs curious than his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for cleanſing, reducing the Calibre bore of the Cannon to the extreameſt Nicity of exactneſs; he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102922:39"/>

                     <head>Of the Gondola's.</head>
                     <p>I Do much queſtion if Human Induſtry can add any farther Perfection to the Gondola's they uſe at <hi>Venice,</hi> inſtead of the Coaches in other Places. Their Figure and Lightneſs are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extraordinary; the middle ſort are Thirty two foot long, and Four in the middle, which inſenſibly diminiſh until the Extremities end at laſt in two very ſharp ends or points, which are rais'd directly up to the full height of a Man: Upon the riſing of the Prow or head of the Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la there is an Iron of an extraordinary large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not above half a Finger thick, but full Four in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102922:40"/>
breadth, and ſet with the edge forwards; the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of this Iron is conſiderably broader than the reſt, being advanc'd out like the head of a great Cleaver that is ſomething better than a Foot broad; ſo dividing the Air by the ſwift motion of the Gondola, it looks as if it would cut down whatſoever oppoſeth its paſſage.</p>
                     <p>The better to ſtrengthen theſe high and ſlight ends of the Gondola's, againſt the rough ſhocks they ſometimes occaſion each other, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to ſet off the great Iron head, there are fixed under it ſix other Plates of Iron at Four Inches diſtance each, Eight or Ten Inches long, and ſomething more than Three broad, which Plates are round and much broader at the out end, than where it is faſten'd at the head: in ſhort, it is all Hammer work, fil'd and ſo curiouſly poliſh'd, that it is no ways leſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming to the Gondola, than neceſſary to the ſafety and ſtrengthening of the Prow.</p>
                     <p>As the Gondola's do ſeldom come foul of each other by the Poope or lower end, ſo there is only a ſquare Iron that comes up from the Keel, and Flat but round, at the Top, upon which moſt have inſtead of large Nailes, Foli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and other wrought Works of Iron, which repreſents the Poope of the Gondalo, no ways leſs pleaſing than the Iron at the Head, which they call a <hi>Dolphin;</hi> only Ambaſſadours, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Princes, and ſuch as are not ſubject to the Laws of Regulating Apparel, and theſe ſort of things can pretend to have <hi>Dolphins</hi> at both ends of their Gondola's.</p>

                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:102922:40"/>
The Gondolaes are not built of this great length ſo much for the conveniency of Carriage, as for the dextrous working of them; their head is built up like a litle Ridge, which returns equally ſloping to the ſides; the Prow is round at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and totally raiſed out of the Water; for the greater expedition it is likewiſe raiſed and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as the Head; The whole Body of the Gondola is ſo neatly rubb'd over with a mixture of Pitch and Oil, that it perfectly looks like Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh: Under the Water they are tallowed with black Greaſe, that gives them an extraordinary eaſie paſſage through the Water, they ſeem to divide.</p>
                     <p>When they fit out a Gondola, they ſpread a long Carpet at the bottom of it, upon Planks that are very well joyn'd, which reach from the Poop unto the Two Steps at the cover'd part of the Head end, which are there made for the conveniency of coming in and going out. They fix in the middle of the Gondola, a covering of about Eight Foot long, under which one may ſtand upright. This is ſupported by Two great Demi-Circles, whoſe Four ends being pointed, are fixed into as many niches in the ſides; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral long ſticks handſomly turn'd at the ends, are faſtned at the top of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <note place="margin">Il felee.</note> that ſupport the Tilt, which is upon occaſion, caſt over all the reſt to defend them from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of the Weather.</p>
                     <p>At the lower end of this Cover, they place croſs-ways a Board covered with black Leather that ſerves for a Seat; as likewiſe <note place="margin">Il traſto.</note> another Bench handſomly covered againſt the Demi-circle behind, which ſerves as a Back-board
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102922:41"/>
to a couple of Perſons that may conveniently ſit here, as the moſt Honourable Place: They have likewiſe a Bench on each ſide of the firſt, that will hold Four People, or Six, if cloſe plac'd together, whoſe Backs are ſupported by Two long Poles, and Boards that are on each ſide faſtned to the Pedeſtal of the Circles. When they would defend themſelves from the Rain, they ſpread the great covering of Black Serge, that comes down to the top of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <note place="margin">Il ſopra felce.</note> at which time nothing can look more uncouth, or more like the true reſemblance of a Coffin.</p>
                     <p>The two Circles before-mention'd, are the Two principal pieces of the Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dola, whoſe greateſt Beauty con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſts <note place="margin">Li Cerchi.</note> in the largeneſs of the Front of theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which are made through much ſtrength and ingenuity; to effect it, they take the half of a Hoop about 10 or 12 Inches in breadth, and 3 thick, by the means of certain Engines they bend theſe Circles with the thin ſide brought downwards, whoſe alternative part conſequently maketh the upper ſide of the Circle; and the broader it is in the Front, the more eſtimable it is, to which end they leave the middlemoſt part larger than the ſides, which gives it a very handſom appearance.</p>
                     <p>When a Gondola is handſomly fitted with a ſuit of Curtains, a little black Coverlet fring'd, and neatly tyed about with <note place="margin">Il feleci.</note> Ribbons, as likewiſe Four great Toſſels beating againſt the Circles, which they keep very white, with two leſſer Toſſels for the more handſome comportment of the Body; One cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

theſe Water Machines to be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretty, although they are not allowed to be Adorned with any thing but Black, excepting the Foot-cloth, which is a Moquette, or any other Stuff of that nature.</p>
                     <p>Ambaſſadors, Miniſters of Princes, and other exempted Perſons, that are not of the Body of the Nobility, have uſually their Gondolas carved, and finely Gilt both within and without, Adorn'd with rich Brocades, together with the Arms of the Prince and Ambaſſadors; It is nevertheleſs neceſſary to obſerve the uſual Form and proportion of the common Gondola, without which they will not be agreeable to the Eyes of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who would certainly ridicule them, as they lately did that of an Ambaſſador's from one of the greateſt Princes in <hi>Italy,</hi> who had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Crown upon the top of the covering, which gave them occaſion to compare his Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo to a Pye.</p>
                     <p>Cuſtom and uſe have eſtabliſhed the Left hand in the Gondalo to be the chiefeſt place, but the Reaſons alledg'd for it, in affirming that one is leſs ſubject to be wet on that ſide, by the daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Oars, are directly againſt common Experience; for my own part I am of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that formerly they making uſe but of one Oar, as the Ferry-Boats ſtill continue; which lye of one ſide almoſt equal to the Water, by the ſtanding of the Gondolier in this manner by the Keel's taking ſo much leſs Water, they make not only much more Expedition, but have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an eaſier paſſage; conſequently the perſon on the Left hand hath an eaſier place than the other at the Right, who ſits tottering upon the

                     <p>THey do not follow the ſame Methods in the Gondola's and Boats of <hi>Venice,</hi> as they do in all other places of <hi>Europe;</hi> for here they ſtand an end puſhing forwards with their Oars, who are never more than two, even in the Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dola's of Ambaſſadors; excepting thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may oblige a Perſon of Quality to paſs into the Country, at which times they ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly double the number. The foremoſt Rower ſtands between the covered part of the Boat, and the two Steps at the entrance, who ſupports his Oar upon the ſide of a Board that is raiſed a Foot higher than the edge of the Gondola, about two Fingers thick, and made hollow for the more eaſie play of the Oar.</p>
                     <p>The Gondolier behind ſtands on the Poop, to ſee over the Tilt or Covering, that ſo he may have a right Steerage: He is upon a long Board that reaches above four Fingers beyond the Left ſide of the covered part of the Poop; inſomuch that he is quite out of the Gondola, holding the end of a long Oar that is ſupported on the Right ſide by a piece of Wood like to the other at the head, but about Two Foot high; After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he Rows, keeping ſtroke to the Gondolier before, without which the Gondola can neither go right or even.</p>
                     <p>It is very agreeable to obſerve the Air and Grace theſe Men affect in the management of their Gondola's; they ſtand moſt an end upon their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102922:42"/>
Right Leg, with the Left ſtretch'd out behind them, their Body bending down, and quite out of the Gondola; whereby, if it happens that they run foul of one another at the turning of any corner for want of giving timely notice, or by the breaking of an Oar, they are certain to fall into the Water, which is no great trouble or inconveniency to them; unleſs it chance to fall out at the courſe, where the mighty number of Boats, and the ſwiftneſs of their motion, does not ſeldom occaſion them the utmoſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>As the Gondoliers have not their Oars any ways faſtned to the Gondola, ſo they make their ſtroaks either ſhorter or longer, according to the breadth of the Canal, or the multitude of Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dola's that are frequently ſeen together. Nothing can be more charming than the eaſineſs of this paſſage; you Eat and Drink quietly, Read, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, Sing, Play upon all ſorts of Inſtruments, without any manner of inconvenincy, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of Danger.</p>
                     <p>One cannot, without admiring, behold them paſs ſo direct, ſmooth and faſt; avoid in a moment ſuch obſtacles as one not us'd to them, muſt think impoſſible, turn the corners of the Canals with ſo great exactneſs and expedition, that it is no ways capable of a deſcription; ſtop ſhort in their full courſe, turn or go back with an equal facility; In ſhort, they govern thoſe Boats with the utmoſt dexterity: which are the effects of an Addreſs that cannot but ſurprize all who ſee them.

                     <p>The Veſſel you take at <hi>Turin,</hi> brings you to whatever Houſe you pleaſe in <hi>Venice;</hi> without which conveniency of paſſage, it would be a very difficult Matter to ſee that mighty abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance there is at <hi>Venice,</hi> of all things neceſſary to a great City; Few particulars would be able to build the fine Houſes one ſees here. The Wood is floated down hither, Stone and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are brought partly upon the floated Timber, and partly upon thoſe great <hi>Pontons</hi> that croſs even the <hi>Adriatick Gulph.</hi> In this manner all ſorts of Materials are brought hither by an admirable eaſe, from a thouſand different places into all the ſeveral Quarters and Houſe of this City.</p>

Formerly the <hi>Venetians</hi> were the only Traders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Levant,</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern India,</hi> for their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels received at <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities as were brought from <hi>Egypt, Syria,</hi> and the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> which they afterwards Tranſported into all the Ports of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſelling them at ſuch prizes they were pleas'd to ſet upon them.</p>

                     <p>The moſt conſiderable Trade that remaineth now to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> are only thoſe of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> For which reaſon the vend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their rich Silks, and other principal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, is of the laſt importance to them; therefore they continue theſe Trades with the greateſt application.

                     <p>To render this Commerce more aſſured and eaſy, they have invented a particular Model of a Veſſel, that is properly a Demi-Galeaſſe, here call'd the <hi>Traffique-Gally,</hi> which carries to <hi>Spalatro</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> at a Crown <hi>per</hi> Piece, the Bales of all the Traders in this City; from whence they are carried upon Camels to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and

                     <p>The Commerce they have with <hi>Germany,</hi> is the firſt and the moſt ancient this City hath had; which being not much leſs advantagious to the State than that of the <hi>Levant,</hi> ſo they have omitted nothing that might contribute to the preſervation of it; to which purpoſe the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hath accommodated the <hi>German</hi> Merchants with a very handſom and ancient Palace near the Bridge of <hi>Rialto,</hi> in which they keep their Warehouſe: The Traders of that Nation are very conveniently Lodg'd there, and at a very eaſy Rate, enjoying many extraordinary Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, which do very much contribute to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this Commerce.</p>
                     <p>This Palace is finely Painted on the outſide by <hi>Georgeon</hi> and <hi>Titien;</hi> but much decayed at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet there remaineth ſeveral noble Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; what is moſt valuable in this Magazine, is a Hanging of Gilt Leather, with ſeveral Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, all done by <hi>Paul Veroneſe,</hi> which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly one of the beſt Pieces this Famous Painter ever did.</p>

                        <hi>The Goodneſs of the Air at</hi> Venice.</head>
                     <p>ONe would hardly believe, that the Air of <hi>Venice</hi> is ſo good as it really is; but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience convinces ſuch as continue there all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Seaſons of the year; notwithſtanding the great moiſtneſs of the place, and the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Weather, that paſſes from one Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to another, both in Winter and Summer; ſhould ſeem at firſt to occaſion many indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the People that live in an Air of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The Miſts that are uſually here in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Winters do often continue for ſeveral
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102922:49"/>
days together, ſo thick and cold, that they are not to be endur'd in any other place, without very great inconveniencies; In Summer the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts and extream heats are ſo very frequent, and ſo ſuddenly interrupted with cold Winds, Rains and Storms, that it is much to be admired, that in a City where they are not us'd to have three days of one continu'd weather, yet they ſhould enjoy an Air, incomparably more ſweet and healthful, than thoſe we find in the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and temperate Climates.</p>
                     <p>The pernicious Effects of the Evening Air that reigns in all other parts of <hi>Italy</hi> are altogether unknown at <hi>Venice;</hi> Old and Young go bare-headed here Night and Day, both Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Summer, without the leaſt inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies; and by the particular benignity of the Air, Rheums and Defluxions are leſs frequent here, than in any other place I ever knew; one cannot deſire a greater demonſtration of this Truth, than by what may be obſerv'd in the Churches, or in any other great concourſe of the People, where during the ſeaſons moſt liable to Coughs and Colds, it is very rare to hear the leaſt ſymptomes of them.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, to the goodneſs of the Air is due the Colour and Complexions of both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which are much better and more lively than thoſe who live at <hi>Rome;</hi> as likewiſe in moſt parts of the other Cities of <hi>Italy:</hi> Their Teeth are ſound and white; their Heads are well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with good full Hair, which grows very faſt, eſpecially among the Nobles, who are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102922:50"/>
curious of it, which is much the better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not accuſtom themſelves to the uſe of Hats: In ſhort, it is very ſurprizing, that however hot the day is, which occaſions the Nights to ſeem the colder, and more dangerous all over <hi>Italy,</hi> yet at <hi>Venise</hi> they undreſs to their Shirts, ſo paſs the Evening uncovered in their Gondola's, or in walking by the Canals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving the leaſt of inconveniencies.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt part of ſuch who find themſelves, convinc'd by experience, and who are loath to admit the Air to be naturally good in ſuch a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, attribute the cauſe of this healthfulneſs to the great number of Fires, that muſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be in ſo compact and populous a City: for my own part I do not deny, but that the great number of Fires may for a time reſiſt the bad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of an ill Air; but I am perſwaded, beſides the accuſtomed moderation of their Hearths at <hi>Venice,</hi> that it is ſcarcely to be believed that the ordinary Fires of a Town can have ſo much in-influence as to alter the nature of the Air, and render it healthful in all times of the year.</p>
                     <p>It may be believed with more probability that the continual ſalt Vapours of the Sea, with which this Air muſt abound; preſerves it in one conſtant quality, and more eaſily hinders thoſe various inonveniencies, as being leſs ſubject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the thick exhalations of the Earth, which are undoubtedly of a more ſuffocating nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of corroſive Salts that abound in moſt Grounds, which have a greater force and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to corrupt the goodneſs of the Air, than
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102922:50"/>
the ſtrongeſt influences of the moſt malevolent Planets; ſo allowing that the nature of the place renders the Air of <hi>Venice</hi> ſubject to frequent alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, yet nevertheleſs it preſerves it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out altering the quality.</p>
                     <p>However, to ſpeak truth, the Climate is not very agreeable in Winter, for as this City is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where open, ſo it is conſequently expoſed to all Winds; this ſeaſon is ſo cold and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome here, that I may ſay, as it is hotter here than it is at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo one feels a more ſharper cold, but indeed it is not of ſuch long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; to which may be replied, that it is not ſo eaſy to keep off the Cold here, as it is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places, for whatſoever Care one uſes in cloſing the Curtains of the Gondola, yet they can never be ſo cloſe as the well fix'd Glaſſes of a Coach.</p>
                     <p>Yet the pleaſure of <hi>Venice</hi> in the Summer does amply recompence the inconveniencies of the Winter; for during the greateſt Heats you are no ſooner in your Gondola, but you are ſure to enjoy upon the Canals, even at Noon-day, a moſt agreeable refreſhing Air: but it is moſt commonly Two Hours before Sun ſet, that one begins to be ſenſible of thoſe delightful Breezes that are yet infinitely more pleaſant in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at which time you enjoy the pleaſure of the Water without diſturbance, frequently meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extraordinary good Voices, and upon the great Canal extraordinary fine Concerts of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, which the Gallants of the City have in Boats to Serenade the Ladies and Nuns who are much pleaſed with theſe Diverſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:102922:51"/>
They are ſo extreamly fond here of theſe Nigh Concerts, that upon the leaſt notice of them' the great Canal is oftentimes not large enough for thoſe great number of Gondola's that come to partake of the Diverſion; the liberty of the Night, and ſweetneſs of the Air equally inſpires with deſire both Sexes to paſs away <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſhabille</hi> the Evenings upon the Water: every one endeavours to avoid being known, ſo you find a mighty ſilence in the midſt of this great concourſe, fully and quietly enjoying the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Muſick, and the moſt agreeable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the cool Breezes.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea and</hi> Lagunes <hi>of</hi> Venice.</head>
                     <p>I will finiſh this firſt part with the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations I have made upon the Ebbe and Flood, which are very conſiderable both in the <hi>Lagunes</hi> and City of <hi>Venice-</hi> The Tide does regularly Ebbe and Flow Twice in Four and twenty Hours, which keeping the Water ever clean and clear in the Canals, is one of the greateſt conveniencies, and thoſe extraordinary advantages that <hi>Venice</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys in her Situation, as likewiſe one of the moſt particular things worthy of a Stranger's obſervation.</p>
                     <p>There are two reaſons of admiration in the Ebbe and Flood of the <hi>Lagunes</hi> at <hi>Venice.</hi> The firſt is becauſe we have not thorougly penetrated into the general cauſes of the Sea's riſing and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102922:51"/>
falling; the ſecond is, ſeeing there is ſcarce any appearance of either Ebbe or Flood in the whole <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Adriatick</hi> Gulph, yet that of the <hi>Lagunes</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> is very great, as likewiſe regulated to certain times.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not amuſe my ſelf and the Reader by reporting the many extravagant opinions of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Authours, in relation to the general cauſes of ſo extraordinary a matter. Some do only entertain the curioſity of their Readers with Fables, and others with ſuch improbable and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe reaſons, as merit no conſideration here. Among the Philoſophers of the preſent Age, <hi>Galileas</hi> hath very ingeniouſly attributed it to the motion of the Earth, making it appear as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence to the reaſons he alledges for it.</p>
                     <p>Not to detain my ſelf upon a matter that may be difficult to render apparent, I ſhall think it ſufficient to obſerve here that the Ebbe and Flood does anſwer exactly to the motion of the Moon, falling every day, like her, 50 Minutes later than the preceding; the Tides being higher in the new and full Moons, than in either of the other quarters, as alſo the ſame difference between the Equinoctial and Solſtice; it is much to be ſuppos'd that the Body and motion of the Moon are the real cauſes of the Ebbe and Flood, as likewiſe thoſe many various accidents that attend them.</p>
                     <p>As the Opinion of Monſieur <hi>Deſcartes</hi> is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory with all the probability that can be deſir'd, in reference to this Wonder that hath for ſo many Ages kept the World in Suſpence;

ſo it is reaſonable we ſhould admit it for the beſt, at leaſt until Reaſon or Experience ſhall make thoſe Diſcoveries that may afford our Judgments more Natural and Senſible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the contrary: So allowing this to be the general Cauſe of the Ebbes and Floods, one may in Courſe come to the Reaſon of thoſe in the <hi>Lagunes</hi> at <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible that the Cauſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the Flux and Reflux of the Ocean, ſhould have thoſe Effects in that vaſt Maſſe of Water without making any Impreſſion upon thoſe of the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> but the reaſon why it is not ſo very apparent, muſt be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the manner of the Tides flowing in the Ocean, which is throughout that Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Tropicks</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> from the <hi>South</hi> to the <hi>North:</hi> Whereas the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> lying conſiderably on this ſide the <hi>Tropick,</hi> and only a ſort of a great Canal from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and very ſmall of breadth in compariſon to the Ocean; ſo it is not to be imagin'd that the Flux and Reflux can be very ſenſible there, as well becauſe this Sea is very narrow in breadth from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> as likewiſe by reaſon of the diſtant ſituation from the <hi>Line</hi> and <hi>Tropicks</hi> in which places the Flux hath the moſt conſiderable effects.</p>
                     <p>From hence it comes that the Tides make but a ſmall impreſſion upon the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> which not being able to move the Waters, cauſeth in them only Currents in many places; as may be obſerv'd in the Sea of <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Phare of <hi>Meſſina</hi> and ſeveral other Iſlands of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102922:53"/>
the <hi>Archipelago:</hi> But as the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea is a Gulph of the <hi>Meditarrenean,</hi> and the moſt <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> part of it, ſo conſequently the impreſſion it ſuffers being neither interrupted or ſtopt by ſuch Coaſts at the mouth of the Gulph, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders its flowing in moſt other places, ſo it muſt indubitably occaſion the Waters to fall in here, keeping their courſe along the Coaſts to the very utmoſt end of the Gulf, where being ſtopt, they muſt neceſſarily riſe until they have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a moderate height.</p>
                     <p>This is exactly what is obſerv'd in this Sea, for upon the Coaſts of <hi>Calabria</hi> and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples</hi> you can only remark a ſetting of the Water without any manner of Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but in the middle of the Gulph and at <hi>Ancona</hi> the Flood begins to be viſibly apparent, which becomes infinitely more ſenſible at <hi>Rimini, Ravenna,</hi> upon the <hi>Lido</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and at <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea,</hi> which lies directly in the very bottom of the Gulph.</p>
                     <p>The Flux of the Ocean is greater as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the places where it begins, which is between the Two <hi>Tropicks,</hi> conſequently cauſing the Tides to be much higher upon the <hi>Northern</hi> than upon the <hi>Southern</hi> Coaſts; ſo the Tide of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Gulph, making only a ſmall impreſſion in the beginning, by degrees ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at the lower end of the Sea a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Tide, and the more by reaſon this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever gains new force by its continuation.</p>
                     <p>So I am at preſent to give my reaſon for the Tides being much higher in the <hi>Lagunes</hi> and Canals of <hi>Venice,</hi> than they are even in the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102922:54"/>
Gulph it ſelf. I attribute it to the nature and diſpoſition of the Place, which I have already deſcrib'd in the beginning of this part, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be Plains that the Sea overflow'd when ſhe made thoſe Breaches in that Neck of Land which formerly denied her entrance: For that little the Flood is in the Sea, is by theſe natural Dikes which ſuſtain the violencies, and afterward permitting an open paſſage into the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> mightily increas'd; eſpecially after having paſs'd thoſe Channels formerly mention'd, it comes to be of ſo much conſideration, by many reaſons more palpable than thoſe I have alledg'd, that what is not but little conſiderable in the Sea, occaſions of courſe a very conſiderable Flood in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſhort there is Six hours Tide of Flood, which being ſtopt by the Coaſts of <hi>Terra firma,</hi> it then commonly riſes to the height of Four foot in the Canals of <hi>Venice;</hi> ſo takes its Courſe to the Sea through the Waters, being fallen by the Ebbe of the Gulph which affords it the requiſite means of returning in the ſame ſpace of time, and through the ſame places that the Flood brought it into the <hi>Lagunes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One may in a Calm Seaſon at the Mouth of the <hi>Lido</hi> obſerve with much pleaſure the making of the Tide; you ſee of a ſudden, and from time to time behold certain great Waves that mount themſelves above the ſmooth ſurface of the Water, which after having for ſome time held a murmuring and impetuous Courſe, do at length looſe themſelves in the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderabe diſtance from the place where they firſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102922:54"/>
appear'd. In this manner the Water is rais'd by the Flood, and the <hi>Lagunes</hi> Swell'd like a great Sea, whoſe Iſlands in the middle ſeem to be as many Sands and half drown'd Cities.</p>
                     <p>At, or about half Ebbe, you begln to ſee the <hi>Lagunes</hi> lie uncover'd of W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ter, which then ſeem to be about the City ſo many fine Meadows, croſs which the Tide hath made ſeveral Canals for the diſcharge of the Waters, which are at all times deep enough for the greateſt Barque; to which purpoſe the moſt conſiderable of them are, as hath been obſerved, ſet out with Piles by which they keep on their Way when the <hi>Lagunes</hi> are cover'd, without any danger of running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground.</p>
                     <p>It is nothing leſs particular than agreeable to behold the Canals of this City that ſeem to be ſo many Rivers, change the Courſe of their Stream every Six hours; which is more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the great Canals, but eſpecially in ſuch as are long, ſtraight, and whoſe extremities lie to the Sea; they receive the Water directly without any circulation, which muſt always diminiſh ſomething of that Force, attending the motions of the Ebbe and Flood of theſe Tides.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable at <hi>Venice</hi> that the Canals after the Winter Solſtice, and eſpcially in <hi>February</hi> are drain'd ſo very low, that they are frequently not able to make uſe of their Gondola's for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hours, between the times of Ebbe and Flood, excepting the great Canal, which by reaſon of the great Currant there, both in the ebbing and flowing of the Tides, does always preſerve a ſufficient depth, without being ever
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102922:55"/>
cleanſed, which they are frequently oblig'd to do with extraordinary charges in the other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the blowing of the Syroc which is the <hi>South-eaſt</hi> Wind, the Tide flows ſo high as to cover with Water all the Keys of the City; the quarter from whence this Wind comes, does di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly anſwer the Situation of the Gulph, and ſo mightily augments the ſtrength of the Tide, that the Sea did once overflow all the Streets and Places, and fill'd with ſalt Water all the Wells of <hi>Venice.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Paduans</hi> who were Lords of theſe Iſlands of the <hi>Lagunes</hi> had a Port at that of <hi>Rialto,</hi> where their River then Terminated. They reſolv'd upon making this a conſiderable place, not only as an Aſylum, but likewiſe to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their Commerce at Sea; To which purpoſe in the Year 421. The Senate of <hi>Padua</hi> ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three Conſuls and declar'd <hi>Rialto</hi> a place of Refuge to all ſorts of People; which occaſioned it to be Peopled in a very little time, as well by Perſons of all conditions that retired thither from the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> as by thoſe that were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd in the other ſeveral Iſlands of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunes.</hi>

                     <p>The third Irruption of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> under <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> reduced <hi>Italy</hi> to a moſt miſerable condition.

The miſerable remainders of ſo many Cities, compleated the inhabiting with all ſorts of People not only the Iſlands of <hi>Rialto,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all thoſe in the <hi>Lagunes</hi> and near the ſides of the Sea, particularly the <hi>Lido</hi> of <hi>Malamoco;</hi> there being no hopes left to theſe People of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their former habitations, they now begun to lay the foundations of what were to be their future abodes, fetching away the ſtones and Marble of the Demoliſhed Palaces upon <hi>Terra firma;</hi> to build themſelves others more ſafe in theſe Iſlands; ſo in about Fifty Years time both the People of Quality and thoſe of the lower Ranks were conveniently accommodated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Reſpective Conditions.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>In the Year 709 the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the twelve Principal Iſlands of the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> Judging it Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enter into a better Method of governing theſe Iſlands that were ſo Extreamly Populous, thought fit to compoſe a Republick and chooſe one amongſt them for chief: But as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd they could not proceed in this manner, without prejudicing the Rights the City of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi> had in theſe places to which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted for ſafety, ſo they ſent Deputy's to the Emperour who was Sovereign Lord of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as likewiſe to Pope <hi>John</hi> the fifth, to obtain Permiſſion of chooſing a Prince, to whom they gave the Name of <hi>Duke</hi> or Doge.</p>
                     <p>This Circumſtance is obſerved by their own <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> who have it, that after the <hi>Tribunes</hi> had obtain'd this grant, they met in <hi>Heraclea</hi> a City of the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> of which there remains only ſome Ruines near the place where the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Piave</hi> diſcharges it ſelf into the <hi>Lagunes;</hi> there they Elected Paul <hi>Lucio Anafeſte</hi> for their firſt Doge, in the Year 709 being two hundred eighty eight years after the proclaiming of the <hi>Rialto</hi> by the <hi>Paduans</hi> for a City of Refuge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet although it ſeems that the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> ſhould denie her beginning from the day of this Election, The <hi>Venetians</hi> do nevertheleſs compute it from the Proclamation made at the <hi>Rialto</hi> the 25th of <hi>March</hi> in the Year four hundred twenty and one, as we have already obſerved; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly upon that day do Solemnize the Nativity of the Republick, pretending their's hath three ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular advantages over all other State, being
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102922:59"/>
founded in Freedom, with the Benefit of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and at the ſame time with that of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Until this very time there was no Mention made of <hi>Venice,</hi> for as then there was no City of that Name; <hi>Heraclea</hi> was the firſt Seat of the Republick, and ſo continued until the Death of the third Doge, whom the People murthered for his cruelty, reſolving to have no more Princes, whoſe abſolute powers eaſily degenerated into <hi>Tyranny;</hi> This occaſioned an <hi>Interregnum</hi> of Five Years, during which the Republick was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Eldeſt Knights annually Elected.</p>
                     <p>But the People growing weary of this ſort of Government, deſire for the future a Doge; who was Elected at the <hi>Lido</hi> of the old <hi>Malamoco,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half a League farther into the Sea than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Malamoco,</hi> which former was totally ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up without leaving the leaſt Appearances where it had been. The Doges continued to reſide at <hi>Malamoco</hi> until <hi>Obelerio</hi> the eleventh Prince of this Republick found himſelf oblig'd to abandon the Dogal Dignity, retiring to <hi>Pepin</hi> then Eſtabliſhed King of <hi>Lombardy</hi> by his Father <hi>Charles</hi> the great, who had deſtroyed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Lombards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You find in the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> that <hi>Pepin</hi> was the Sovereign of all theſe provinces, in which quality the Republick payed him an Annual Tribute; who then reſolving to viſit the <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Iſlands</hi> within the Jurisdiction of his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſne,</hi> but being refus'd entrance by the Doge Elected in the Room of <hi>Obelerio,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe ſuſpicions he had of the Kings being Inſtigated, by the Counſel of <hi>Obelerio</hi> to diſturb the quiet of the Republick.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102922:59"/>
                        <hi>Pepin</hi> irritated upon the refuſal, took Arms againſt theſe People, ruin'd <hi>Heraclea,</hi> and went on the other ſide to Attack <hi>Malamoco,</hi> then the Capital Iſland; But finding it abandon'd by the Doge and all the Inhabitants who had ſaved themſelves at the <hi>Rialto,</hi> he reſolv'd to go through with what he had begun, which was to <hi>Attack</hi> them by Sea.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Annals add, That <hi>Pepin</hi> having embarqu'd his Forces upon Floats, to tranſport them by Night to the <hi>Rialto,</hi> there roſe ſo great a Tempeſt, that it broke his Floats, and drown'd moſt part of his Soldiers; which bad ſucceſs ſo alter'd the Courage of the King, that he reſolv'd to leave thoſe people in quiet<hi>:</hi> but deſiring to ſee the <hi>Rialto,</hi> was receiv'd there with ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of Joy, and ſo many Marks of Honour, that in a pure Sentiment of Affection for thoſe People, he threw his Scepter into the Sea, with this Imprecation, <hi>Thus may they periſh who attempt the Peace of this Republick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, the following matter of theſe Annals, and the Teſtimony of ſeveral Creditable Authors, do plainly prove that <hi>Pepin</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the <hi>Rialto,</hi> rather as a generous Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, than a Prince ill treated by bad fortune, to whom the Republick would not have conſented after the loſs of his Army, what they had obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſed when he was in a condition of getting it by force: In ſhort, the King Exercis'd all Acts of Sovereignty, leaving ſeveral marks of liberality to the Doge and Publick, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcharging the Republick of the Tribute they annually payed him, and preſented them
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102922:60"/>
with five Miles of extent on <hi>Terra firma</hi> againſt the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> with ample liberty of Trafficking both by Sea and by Land.</p>
                     <p>It is moreover ſaid that <hi>Pepin</hi> obſerving the Doge to wear no External mark of dignity, took off one of the Sleeves of his Veſt, and put it upon the Doge's Head in the form of a Bonnet; from whence comes the Original of the <hi>Ducal Horn,</hi> ſo Named from the pointed end of this Sleeve upon his head; It was then that <hi>Venice</hi> received the firſt time, this appellation, for <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> would have the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Rialto,</hi> with the other Neighbouring <hi>Iſlands,</hi> to bear the Name of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> which was then that of the whole Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring province to the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> and that the <hi>Rialto</hi> ſhould be from thence forwards the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Doges and Senate of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were the beginnings and firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes of the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth her Principal Eſtabliſhment and firſt Grandeur, to be owing to the magnanimity and generous Conduct of a <hi>French</hi> King.</p>

                     <p>BY what hath been ſaid, it may be obſerved that this Republick was ſubject during her Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to many changes, and ſeveral methods of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for if we reckon from the beginning
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102922:60"/>
of the Year 421, they were the <hi>Couſuls</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> who Govern'd this State: The Power of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi> continued without Interruption near upon 300 Years: The Doges Reign'd after them with an abſolute Power for ſeveral Ages: Yet before the Government arrived to that Degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Policy they now have, there happen'd under the Doges ſeveral conſiderable changes, which I ſhall obſerve in this Relation.</p>
                     <p>From the firſt Election made in the Year 709, at <hi>Heraclea</hi> of <hi>Paul Lucio Anafeſte,</hi> until that of <hi>Sebaſtian Ziani,</hi> the Doges reign'd with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority, the People electing him by their Acclamations whom they Judg'd moſt worthy of the Dogal dignity, who Acted as Monarch, for he was Maſter of his own Council, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to any body for his Adminiſtration; in ſhort, he had a deſpotick Power both in Peace and War: The Hiſtory of <hi>Venice</hi> gives us the Examples of ſeveral Doges that made their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or their Children, to be elected for their Collegues and Succeſſours.</p>
                     <p>But the Sovereign Authority of the Prince having oftentimes expos'd the State to many dangerous accidents, and the Tumultuary Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the People frequently ending with the greateſt Inconveniencies; The Principal Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens met together upon the Death of their Prince <hi>Vital Micheli,</hi> to conſult how they might prevent thoſe diſorders before they proceeded to the election of a new Doge, and accordingly choſe eleven Perſons of Probity, who retiring into the Church of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> elected <hi>Sebaſtian Ziani;</hi> And to take for the future from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102922:61"/>
the right they had of chooſing the Doge; as likewiſe at the ſame time to moderate the great Authority of the Prince, they eſtabliſhed an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant Council, from which ſhould be drawn by Election the Electors of the Doge.</p>
                     <p>An alteration of this conſequence that eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed an intire new method of Government, would without diſpute have caus'd a Revolution in the State, but they found an expedient that pleas'd the People, which was to allow them in exchange the liberty of Nominating Twelve <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who ſhould have Power of oppoſing the Ordinances of the Prince, which ſhould be of no validity if they were not approv'd by them; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving in this to follow the Example of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Government of <hi>Rome.</hi> Their <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who were two in each of the Six Wards of the City, had moreover a right of chooſing every Year upon the Feaſt of Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> Forty ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as they judg'd proper in each Ward or Quarter, to Compoſe the great Council they then eſtabliſh'd, conſiſting of Two Hundred and Forty Citizens impartially choſen, and without diſtinction in all the different Eſtates, to wit, the <hi>Nobility, Citizens</hi> and <hi>Tradeſmen;</hi> as this Council was to be renewed every Year, ſo every one was to be of it in his turn, or at leaſt had the right of pretending to it.</p>
                     <p>This method of Government continued a Hundred and Seventeen Years unto the Year 1289; At which time the Doge <hi>Peter Gradenigue,</hi> took upon him the intire alteration of the form of this Republick, and to eſtabliſh a perfect <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> in fixing the great Council for ever
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102922:61"/>
to a certain Number and their Deſcendants, who taking upon themſelves for the future the whole Cognizance of all matters of State, were to have the Sovereign Adminiſtration excluſive to all the other Families.</p>
                     <p>Whether this Doge was deſirous to aboliſh <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical</hi> government, out of a good Intention to the welfare of his Country, or by a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret paſſion of being reveng'd on theſe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that oppoſed his Election, is uncertain; but he paſſ'd a Decree in the Council of <note n="*" place="margin">A Soveraign Court of Forty Judges.</note> Forty, which Ordered, <hi>That all ſuch who had compos'd the Great Council for the Four preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Years, ſhould be ballotted in this Chamber; and thoſe who had Twelve Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Balls, ſhould be, with their Deſcendants, admitted to the Great Council for ever.</hi> He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this Decree to be Regiſtred, and took his Meaſures ſo well that he excluded all ſuch as were diſaffected to him.</p>
                     <p>However, unjuſt and unequal this proceeding ſeems to be in regard of ſeveral conſiderable Families, yet the Republick owes to it the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the perfecteſt Government that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, and which happily continues to this very time: It is Nevertheleſs to be ſuppoſed that ſuch a change was not made without occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning great troubles in the Republick; but they were ſoon quaſh'd by puniſhing of the Weak, and Satisfying of the more Powerful, with ſuch Privileges as exempted them from the Number of the excluded.</p>

                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102922:62"/>
Several Noble Families that did not then fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the mighty conſequence of this excluſion, yet irritated to ſee ſuch preferr'd before them as were their Inferiors, did however detain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from diſcovering their Reſentments, as poſſibly not thinking that by this Eſtabliſhment, which is called, <hi>Il ſerrar del Conſiglio,</hi> the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which Compos'd it ſhould mount to thoſe high Degrees of Preferment as for ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Maſters, and they the Subjects to be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly govern'd by them for the future, who were only to have for their ſhare a paſſive and blind obedience.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Bagamonte Trepolo,</hi> Chief of one of the firſt and Ancienteſt Families of the Republick, Joyn'd by the <hi>Quirini,</hi> and ſome other Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Families, animated by the hatred they had to the perſon of the <hi>Doge Gradenica,</hi> as likewiſe incenſed againſt thoſe Novelties he made in the State, entered into a Bloody Confederacy, to free themſelves by Aſſaſſinating the <note n="*" place="margin">The Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Council of Ten.</note> Doge and all his Party; but this Chief, with ſeveral of his Confederates, periſhed in the attempt, which gave occaſion to thoſe New Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that have maintain'd and will preſerve this Government for the future, in that Vigour and Union we behold it at preſent.</p>
                     <p>Before we enter into the particulars of the Government of this Republick, it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay ſomething of thoſe who are the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; That is, of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentry, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>terra firma;</hi> for through an admirable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,

                     </head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentry pretend themſelves to be of a more ancient deſcent, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nobility in <hi>Europe;</hi> Some of theſe Nobles that were never beyond their <hi>Lagunes,</hi> do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there is no difference between a Noble <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> and a Sovereign Prince: But not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my ſelf with theſe Ridiculous fancies, I ought to ſay before I enter into the Particulars of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, that it is true accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſentiments of the moſt experienc'd <hi>Genealogiſts,</hi> that it is very difficult, not to ſay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, for particular families to produce Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Acts of their Nobility for above Six Hundred Years, eſpecially to prove exactly a higher line of deſcendance.</p>
                     <p>Whether this difficulty proceeds from the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care of thoſe who preceeded us, or that the great Revolutions to which all States are liable, by confounding the order of things, may not have been the occaſion of it, or laſtly, that our Families not being diſtinguiſh'd by Names, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thoſe times, are the real cauſe of diſabling us from penetrating into the obſcurity it hath brought into this part of <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> I do mantain that none of theſe Reaſons are valid, in regard of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102922:63"/>
the ancient Families of <hi>Venice;</hi> there being thoſe that have indubitable proofs of an Antiquity not only equal, but likewiſe which are before the time of the firſt Foundation of this Republick.</p>
                     <p>The truth of this will admit of no Objection, if we obſerve that the <hi>Faliers</hi> and <hi>Candians</hi> with ſeveral other Noble <hi>Paduans</hi> that were ſent by the Senat as the firſt Conſuls to the <hi>Rialto;</hi> and that the <hi>Tribunes</hi> who govern'd afterwards theſe Iſlands for three Centurys together, were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality Powerful both in Effects and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as the <hi>Badouaire's</hi> at the <hi>Rialto;</hi> ſo if the Families that bear theſe Names at preſent in <hi>Venice,</hi> are really deſcended from thoſe who were formerly there diſtinguiſh'd by them; it muſt be granted that the antiquity of this Nobility, goes much beyond thoſe Limits the <hi>Genealogiſts</hi> preſcribe.</p>
                     <p>The proofs that may be deduc'd for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of theſe Families without any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, appear ſo much more Authentick, as they are Eſtabliſh'd upon ſuch acts that are no ways liable to any manner of Falſification<hi>:</hi> They being taken partly from the <hi>Hiſtory of Venice,</hi> which is the leſs to be Suſpected of Corruption in regard to the Antiquity of the Nobility, by Reaſon the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> had no deſign in promoting it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe proofs is, that there never happen'd at <hi>Venice</hi> any of thoſe Revolutions that by Wars, Seiges and Burnings deſtroyed the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of things, or that at leaſt have troubled the order and confounded the knowledge of matters; neither hath there been thoſe ſorts of Interruptions and Suppoſitions, which have in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102922:63"/>
other Countries inſenſibly disjointed the deſcents of Families which even hinder us at preſent from attaining the True Knowledge of them.</p>
                     <p>The Second and ſtrongeſt of all the proofs to be alledg'd, is taken from the ſame Hiſtory, where we find the Names of the <hi>Noble Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to be always certain, as never aſſuming the Names of either <hi>Titles</hi> or <hi>Dignities,</hi> which they uſually do in <hi>France.</hi> The ſame Cuſtom is yet inviolably obſerved at <hi>Venice,</hi> and as one of the Fundamental Laws of the State.

                     </head>
                     <p>THE firſt Order of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, conſiſts in thoſe twelve Families that were the twelve Electors of the firſt Doge of this Republick, which have wonderfully preſerv'd themſelves unto this inſtant; in which length of time, many other great Houſes are intirely extinguiſh'd: Thoſe twelve Families which they called Electoral are <hi>Contarini, Moroſini, Badouari, Tripoli, Micheli, Sanudi, Gradenighi, Memmi, Falieri, Dandoli, Polani, &amp; Barozzi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, this antiquity is of no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them, excepting a general conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may occaſion them to be preferr'd before others in either Employments or Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, provided that their merits be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their birth; through which means ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of theſe Ancient Families have particularly rais'd themſelves of late, for the new Nobility
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102922:64"/>
created by Money, have not been able to find a ſhorter way, or a more Honourable method of eſtabliſhing themſelves, as likewiſe to come into Reputation, than by purchaſing the Alliance of the Ancient Nobles.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of theſe great Houſes which have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd themſelves in the higheſt conſideration, upon the account of their great Riches and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, are the <hi>Contarini</hi> and the <hi>Moroſini;</hi> It is the common Opinion that the firſt were Counts of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> before they ſettled here, which is now ſomething more than Twelve Hundred Years; Yet they have no other Proofs of this Original, than the pretended Etymology of their Name: This Houſe increas'd to ſuch a degree, that it is divided at leaſt into Fifty ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Branches; neither is there any in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick that Counts a greater Number of Heads in the Great Council, and conſequently can make a more Powerful Faction.</p>
                     <p>That of <hi>Moroſini</hi> is likewiſe one of the moſt numerous, and moſt conſiderable for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; after theſe two Families follow the <hi>Badou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ari,</hi> the <hi>Tripoli, Micheli, Gradenighi</hi> and the <hi>Sanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> which yet continue to be of great conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this State; The <hi>Memmi, Falieri &amp; Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doli,</hi> are neither Rich in Effects, or Powerful by their Parties; the <hi>Polani &amp; Barozzi,</hi> live in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, rather through the defect of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, than by the want of Riches, which they might ſufficiently find in the more Powerful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the New Nobility, if they could but diſtinguiſh themſelves fit to be rais'd by ſuch Alliances.</p>

                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:102922:65"/>
Next to theſe Twelve Electoral Houſes, there are four Families that do not yield much in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity to them, for they are eſtabliſhed upon the moſt Authentick Records, which were ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Year 800, upon a Contract made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Abbey</hi> of St. <hi>George Major,</hi> and the before-mention'd Twelve Houſes, for which Reaſon the firſt are called the Twelve Apoſtles, and the others the four Evangeliſts; They are the <hi>Juſtiniani, Cornari, Bragadini,</hi> and the <hi>Bembi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cornari</hi> and <hi>Juſtiniani,</hi> have maintain'd themſelves in a much greater Figure than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the firſt hath had Alliances with Crown'd Heads; it was moreover a Daughter of this Houſe Married to the laſt King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> that brought this Kingdom to the Republick, which they poſſeſs'd until the conqueſt of it, by <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha Baſſa,</hi> General to the Emperor <hi>Zelim.</hi> The <hi>Juſtiniani</hi> are reckon'd at <hi>Venice</hi> to be of the Blood of the Emperors of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for which Reaſon they bear the <hi>Spread Eagle</hi> as <hi>their Arms.</hi> The <hi>Annals of Venice</hi> do mention <hi>a very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Paſſage to this Houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Republick having juſt Reaſons of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments againſt the Emperour, who did ill by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Merchants Trading into the <hi>Levant,</hi> they made War with him at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> under the Doge <hi>Nidal Micheli,</hi> about the Year 1156, All of the Family of <hi>Juſtiniani,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd upon this Fleet of a Hundred Ships, which the Republick fitted out to Sea in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Days, to go and revenge themſelves for the wrongs they pretended were done them by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in depriving them of their goods, as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102922:65"/>
likewiſe of their Right to the ſucceſſion of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>After the conqueſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Nege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi> this Army was ruin'd before <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> through Miſery and Sickneſs, but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by reaſon of the Waters which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Emmanuel</hi> caus'd to be Poiſoned. All the <hi>Juſtiniani</hi> dyed in this expedition, but the Doge <hi>Micheli,</hi> being deſirous to re-eſtabliſh ſo Noble a Family, obtained to this Purpoſe a Commiſſion from the Pope to take from a Convent, Brother <hi>Nicolas Juſtiniani,</hi> of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Saint <hi>Benedict,</hi> to whom he gave his Daughter in Marriage; from whence are iſſued all thoſe of this Houſe, who continue to make a very conſiderable Figure in this Republick; But the good <hi>Monk</hi> having had ſeveral Children return'd to his Monaſtery to follow the courſe of life he was in before his Marriage.</p>
                     <p>They do likewiſe comprehend with in the firſt order of Nobility, eight more Houſes, which with the other four make twelve, whoſe Antiquity is in a manner Parallel to thoſe of the firſt twelve, in that long before the <hi>Serrar del Conſiglio,</hi> they were conſiderable, and particularly the <hi>Quirini, Delfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, Soranſi,</hi> the <hi>Zorzi</hi> and the <hi>Marcelli,</hi> which do yet diſtinguiſh themſelves in the Republick; the others are fallen from their former luſtre, through extream Poverty, to which they are reduced.</p>
                     <p>After the General <hi>Tiepolo,</hi> had intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the City of <hi>Acria</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> for having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times revolted againſt the Republick who conquered it; Several Illuſtrious Houſes of that City retired to <hi>Venice,</hi> where they maintain'd
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102922:66"/>
themſelves in a more than ordinary Reputation, before the eſtabliſhment of the great Council, in which they had Seſſion, and are received at preſent among the Nobility of the firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>

Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> the Severity of the Puniſhment does ſoon diſcover the difference which the <hi>Republick</hi> will have between a <hi>Noble Venetian</hi> who is believ'd born to command, and another whoſe Merits lye in Obedience.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Senat</hi> knows very well, that the <hi>Land Nobility</hi> cannot bear without Reſentments the great Elevating of that <hi>Nobility,</hi> and that they are very uneaſy at the thoughts of the Sovereign Power's being lodg'd only with them, to whom they eſteem themſelves no ways infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior; for which Reaſons upon the leaſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that might happen to riſe, the <hi>Senat</hi> could not but have very great Apprehenſions of this <hi>Nobility,</hi> if they lived in a Perfect good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with each other, but they endeavour to keep them at variance, by ſowing Jealouſies among them, when more proper Occaſions are wanting to enervate their Forces.</p>
                     <p>There was a manifeſt proof of this Policy in the time of <hi>Francis Erizzo</hi>'s being <hi>General of the Forces</hi> in <hi>Frivoli,</hi> who was afterwards Elected <hi>Doge.</hi> He obſerved that <hi>the Nobility</hi> of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince living in a very good Intelligence, might poſſibly join themſelves at the firſt Opportunity and declare in Favour of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> to which province he makes great pretenſions, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the <hi>Republick</hi> of a very Advantageous <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi> to their <hi>States;</hi> he acquainted the <hi>Senate</hi> with his ſentiments, who much approv'd the foreſight of their <hi>General,</hi> and the expedient propoſed againſt thoſe dangerous conſequences.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>We ſee by the Annals of <hi>Venice,</hi> that it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Six Hundred Years, ſince there was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator who undertook the care of building this Church, he manag'd the revenue and was a ſort of an Eccleſiaſtical Intendant: The Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102922:73"/>
made a Second Procurator about Fourſcore Years afterwards; but the Revenues of the Church mightily encreaſing, the Republick cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated three Procurators, to each of which was aſſign'd at ſeveral times two Aſſociates, ſo that about two Hundred and Thirty Years ago the Number was ſettled at Nine, who are divided into three Procuratories or Chambers, the firſt is called the Procuratory above Stairs, this takes Cogniſance of whatever regards the Church: The Second and Third have the direction of whatſoever is bequeath'd to the Poor, Inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſide of the Great Canal, as likewiſe thoſe of the other ſide that Canal; for which reaſon theſe Chambers are diſtinguiſh'd by theſe ſeveral Terms, <hi>Di Procuratie di Sopra, di Citra &amp; di <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Republick was not only oblig'd to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Nine Procurators of Saint <hi>Marks,</hi> for to diſpoſe of the great Riches bequeath'd to the Church of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> and the Poor, eſpecially after they were much augmented by the great Gifts of the Rich Doge <hi>Sebaſtian Ziani;</hi> but they were likewiſe willing to encreaſe the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Dignity, that they might be more able to recompence the Services of the Nobility, particularly obſerving that there is nothing ſo ſatisfactory, or ſo much ſought for by the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Nobles.</hi>

                     <p>They that Execute the Nine places of the Ancient Procuratories, are called Procurators by merits, to diſtinguiſh them from ſuch as have bought this dignity; Nevertheleſs, they all enjoy the ſame Privileges, there being no difference between them; excepting that when a Procurator by merit dies, the great Council do proceed always to the choice of another before the deceaſed is Interred; beſides, they do not fill up thoſe that have acquired it by their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but endeavour to reduce them to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber eſtabliſhed; the Nobility that purchas'd the <hi>Veſts of Procurators,</hi> pay'd for them Thirty Thouſand Ducats, but thoſe that I mentioned, who after they had bought their Nobility, would aſcend to this dignity by a ladder of Gold, payed down double that Sum; as not being juſt that the moſt <hi>Junior</hi> Nobility ſhould be uſed on this occaſion with the ſame conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that of the more Ancient Order.</p>
                     <p>All the Procurators wear the <hi>Ducal Veſt,</hi> that is with long Sleeves hanging to the ground; and according to their degree of Seniority, have habitations in the ſtately new

But the Library of which they are the Keepers, and the Chamber of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives</hi> of the <hi>Republick,</hi> to which they are Guardians, as likewiſe the apartment where the Council commonly aſſembles three times a Week, do take up the third part of this Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo there is ſufficient Lodging only for Six Procurators, for which Reaſon the Republick allows the other three reaſonable Penſions, until ſuch time as they have the Accommodation of the Procuratories.</p>
                     <p>Although the ſale of this dignity is of very great Advantage to the Republick, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the conſiderable Summs it raiſes in the preſſing Neceſſities of the <hi>State;</hi> yet the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of it are very Prejudicial to both the Republick and Particulars; for by theſe means, thoſe who ought to maintain the Glory of the Republick, in the Extraordinary Expences of Embaſſies, exempt themſelves upon the account of this Dignity, through which Misfortune the Republick is frequently oblig'd to make uſe of ſuch Gentlemen, who being not able to ſupport the Grandeur as it ought to be, bring themſelves into Inconveniencies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices the Reputation of the Republick.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102922:80"/>
Who Protected you in your Perſecution? Was it not I that did theſe things for you?</p>
                     <p>It is no difficult matter to imagine what ſort of Anſwers are made to theſe Interrogations: But what is incomparably beyond all the reſt, is to hear the Harangue of a <hi>Pretending Curate,</hi> who endeavouring to exalt his own Merits, makes no ſcruple of expoſing the greateſt Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his <hi>Concurrents,</hi> aſſuring them he is not a <hi>Drunkard</hi> as ſuch a one is, nor a <hi>Libertine</hi> like another; and that he gives no Scandal in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Women,</hi> as the third doth: In ſhort, he ſticks not at expoſing the moſt ſecret things, provided he can make any advantage of them to the prejudice of his Adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>The Addreſs of him that was lately Elected in one of the beſt Pariſhes of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſeems to me the more Ingenious by being covered under the Vail of the higheſt Simplicity; this Man, who was the Ancienteſt of the Qualified <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and who probably had formerly miſs'd of his Aim, by too much enlarging upon the Chapter of his own Merits, appear'd now the laſt of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and follow'd a new Method; he came into the middle of the <hi>Company,</hi> leaning upon his Staff, and Coughing very much, where he utter'd theſe few words according to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Expreſſion: <hi>Theſe Gentlemen have obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to appear before you, I can ſay nothing more for my ſelf, than that I am an Honeſt Man; you may make me Curate if you pleaſe, but if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me not, you may let it alone.</hi> This new way made ſo great an Impreſſion upon them, that without examining any further into his Merits,

                     <p>IT may be obſerved by what is ſaid that ſince the Republick hath been govern'd by Doges, there hath happen'd no alteration in their Method of Government, which hath not tended to the Diminution of the Princes Authority; inſomuch that the laſt reform at the <hi>Serrar del Conſiglio</hi> in the Year 1289, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd the Doges of the Credit then remaining to them upon the Creation of that Council, which was one Hundred and Seventeen Years before this reform<hi>:</hi> The <hi>Senat</hi> knows perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well that the Liberty of the Republick is Incompatible with the Intereſts of a Prince that ſhall pretend himſelf to be above the Laws; therefore they have not only Subjected the Doge without any manner of Reſervation; but they have likewiſe added ſome as to his particular, which do in many caſes render his condition Inferiour to that of a private <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour;</hi> thus from being formerly Prince of the Republick he is now become a meer Image and the Real ſhadow of that Majeſty, which the <hi>Senate</hi> truely preſerves within the Limits of her own Power only.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs they raiſe to the Dogal Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuch <hi>Senatours</hi> as have moſt diſtinguiſh'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102922:88"/>
themſelves by their particular <hi>Services,</hi> and they are uſually taken from being Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> or that have honourably ſupported the Dignity of Embaſſadours, the Supreme command of their Fleets, or that have exercis'd the Principal Functions of the State; But as the <hi>Senate</hi> Introduces them into this high place to make uſe of their Names on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Government, ſo the ableſt Senatours are not always the moſt fit Perſons for that Station. The advanc'd Age, eaſy temper and the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Birth are the three principal and moſt eſſential qualities that promote them to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Reaſon of State requires their Princes to be particularly mild and peaceable; that ſo they may yield and ſubmit the eaſier to their ſentiments, as have a greater ſhare than he in the Government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dominico Contarini,</hi> lately Doge, did not paſs through all the degrees that uſually raiſe the <hi>Noble Venetian</hi> to this Dignity, for he was at the time of his being Elected Doge improving the Pleaſures of his Country Seat, but he being of one of the moſt Illuſtrious Families, and which hath at ſeveral times afforded Eight Doges to this Republick, to which may be added an evenneſs of Temper, an Affability ſo charming, and his Perſon ſo Noble and Majeſtical, that he equally gained both the Love and Veneration of the Nobility and People. The Young Gentlemen eſpecially were ſo taken with his Merit, that I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes hear'd them ſay aloud upon obſerving
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102922:88"/>
of him in the Adminiſtration of the publick Functions. <hi>Le adorabile quel vectio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nicolas Sagredo</hi> who ſucceeded him is the firſt Doge of this Family, which is of the Second claſs or order of Nobility; he was made for his great Merits Procurator of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> having been a great while in the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Employs of the Republick, and actually had the greateſt ſhare in the Government of the State: Inſomuch that his Elevation muſt be rather aſcrib'd to his own perticular Merits than to the Factions of his Friends. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſeverity of the Conditions that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Dogal Dignity, yet there were never ſo many known to ſtand for it as upon this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, or ſo many Perſons capable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Duties of this great Place.</p>
                     <p>This Dignity is no ways leſs burthenſome to the Family than it is to the Perſon of the Doge; for his Brothers, Sons and Grandſons can have no conſiderable Employs in the Republick, which have any Affinity with the Government; if they have any or chance to be Embaſſadours, they are oblig'd to quit thoſe Affairs upon his Election. If the Doge is a Married Man, his Wife is not Treated with the Title of <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> neither hath the <hi>Senate</hi> thought fit to Crown them this laſt Age, as being deſirous either to Moderate the Ambition of the Women, or to ſave thoſe great Sums that were expended upon the Coronation of the laſt Princeſs, Wife to the Doge <hi>Martin Crimani.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The particular reſtraint that is laid upon the perſons of the Doges, as likewiſe their ways of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102922:89"/>
and all theſe other Circumſtances of that condition together, are not ſufficient to deter ſuch Families as have given no Doges to the Republick from making their utmoſt Efforts to attain this Honour; by which they do not only hope to bring themſelves into a much greater conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but likewiſe to Eſtabliſh their Fortunes by the Sums they may acquire if the Doge hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to live many Years after his Election; which is one of the Reaſons why the Doge is Created for Life: beſides, if it was for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpace of time only, he would not be ſo much conſider'd in all other Courts, neither would the <hi>Senate</hi> be able to keep him in the great reſtraint that is now impoſed upon him, through the Fear of being depos'd or of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſpection into his conduct after Death, to the mighty Prejudice of his whole Family.</p>
                     <p>As the Republick hath ſometimes forc'd their Princes to aſſume and continue this Dignity, ſo they have likewiſe depos'd others whoſe Age or Infirmities have rendred them uſeleſs to the State; yet in reality the <hi>Republick</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes a greater uſe of their name than their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, upon which Apprehenſions the Doge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſiſts from going to the <hi>Colledge</hi> and all other Courts of Juſtice, to which the Duties of his Station oblige him, unleſs he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf altogether uncapable of doing it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not in the leaſt doubt but that <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico Contarini</hi> did expect ſome ſuch Reſolution, upon his long Indiſpoſition of the Palſy that deprived him for Eighteen Months of the uſe of one ſide of his Body. For when any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102922:89"/>
ſent to compliment him, he always concluded his thanks, with his being much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that he was in hopes to ſee the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in a little time at the <hi>College.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Doge preſides in all the Councils, but he is eſteem'd Prince of the <hi>Republick</hi> only at the head of the <hi>Senate,</hi> at the <hi>Tribunals</hi> where he aſſiſts, and in the Ducal Palace of Saint <hi>Mark;</hi> out of which places he hath much leſs Authority than ſome other particular Perſons; for he dares not engage in any buſineſs whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. There are ſome who have reported in their writings that it is Lawful to affront or kill him upon finding him out of the City, and that he hath not the Liberty to go out of his Palace, It is true that there hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly very ſevere Regulations as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but things are not carried to that <hi>Exire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> at preſent; however he goes not out of the City without asking in a manner leave of his Councellors: <hi>Dominico Contarini</hi> went fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to ſee his Daughters and Nieces that were in ſeveral Nunneries, as likewiſe very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten every Year to his Country Houſe to enjoy the Air of the Continent.</p>
                     <p>When the Doge goes out of the City he is not attended with any External Marks that may diſtinguiſh him from any other <hi>Venetian Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> his apparel is then a gray cloſe Bodied Coat and his ſword by his ſide; if any Noble happens to meet him, he ſeems not to know him to avoid rendring thoſe reſpects that are due to him, when he is with the <hi>Republick;</hi> who are the ſame thing in his abſence as when
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102922:90"/>
he is preſent; upon any particular Viſits that the <hi>Doge</hi> makes in the City, he is only atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded like another Noble, with a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> and two <hi>Gondalo</hi>'s; neither is that diſcernable from another but by a Carpet, and two flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd Sattin Cuſhions againſt the Back-board, which ſmall marks of Dignity are ſo far from being expoſed, that the <hi>Gondaliers</hi> moſt an end cover them all with the black Curtains of the <hi>Gondalo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Dreſs is, on theſe occaſions, like thoſe of the Counſellors, which is Purple, but he wears a General's Cap of the ſame Colour, with his Veſt; it is round made of Paſte-board, only four Fingers high, the Crown flat, and the circumference of the whole, double to what the Entrance of the Head is.</p>
                     <p>They give the <hi>Doge</hi> the Title of your <hi>Scre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and <hi>Moſt Screne Prince;</hi> and that he may be ſenſible that theſe Titles do not belong to his Perſon, all Embaſſadors take care to uſe the ſame Expreſſions when they ſpeak to the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> ſeldom ſaying <hi>your Screnity,</hi> without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>your Excellency's;</hi> being confus'd Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; among which no difference ought to be made in this Aſſembly, where the Majeſty of the <hi>Republick</hi> is dilated upon all the Members that compoſe the <hi>College.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Altho all Diſpatches are made in the Name of the <hi>Prince,</hi> as likewiſe the Anſwers of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors are addreſs'd to him, yet he cannot open them, which may be done and anſwer'd without him; and that he may continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he only lends his Name to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:102922:90"/>
they forbear the Examination of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions made to the <hi>College</hi> by Embaſſadors, or other Miniſters, until ſuch time as he and his Councellors are withdrawn; then the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is examin'd, the Opinions of the Sages are taken, upon which they draw the Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into Writing, which is delivered at the next Aſſembly of the <hi>Senate,</hi> in the Preſence of the <hi>Doge</hi> and his Counſellors, where he hath only a ſingle Vote with the other Senators, to confirm or reject what was done in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>The Money of <hi>Venice</hi> bears the Name of the <hi>Doge,</hi> but it is not made with his Impreſſion upon the Coin, as it was formerly in the time when the <hi>Doge</hi> had the abſolute Power of the Government, there being now, inſtead of his Effigies, a <hi>Doge</hi> in his Ducal Habits upon his Knees to St. <hi>Mark,</hi> to ſhew that the Prince is the Subject of the <hi>Republick,</hi> of which the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is the Hieroglyphick: Yet in the Mint where the Money is Coin'd all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons upon paying the Duties to the Prince, have the Liberty of Coining what Sums they pleaſe; the <hi>Doge</hi> gives the Permiſſion, and enjoys the Advantages proceeding from it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Doge</hi> is allowed by the <hi>Republick</hi> fourteen thouſand Ducats <hi>per Annum,</hi> to defray his Houſhold Expences, and the Charges of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four times in a Year all Embaſſadors, the <hi>Seignory,</hi> and ſuch of the Senators as are aſſiſtant at thoſe Feſtivals: The ordinary Retinue of the <hi>Doge</hi> conſiſts of two <hi>Valets de Chambre,</hi> four
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102922:91"/>
                        <hi>Gondaliers,</hi> and ſome other Servants; the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> diſcharges all other Officers that only wait upon him at publick Ceremonies: He hath the Sellings of the Offices of Commanders of the Palace, who are a ſort of <hi>Serjeants,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Ecuyers,</hi> or <hi>Squires</hi> of the <hi>Doge,</hi> which are 25 in number; from theſe Profits and the Gifts of all Benefices belonging to St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s, ariſe the principal Advantages of his Dignity.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Republick</hi> hath not only inveſted the Prince with all the apparent marks of Sovereign Dignity, but they have alſo obtain'd for him from the <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> the real Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Royal Majeſty, and the preference next to Crown'd Heads of all other Princes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: It is to be admired that they ſhould as it ſeems, go contrary to theſe Advantages of Pre-eminency, by reducing of him to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of all other Princes, in reſpect of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals;</hi> for when a <hi>Cardinal</hi> hath Audience, he ſits on the Right of the <hi>Doge,</hi> in his own Chair, that is made larger upon theſe Occaſions; and upon any particular Viſit, the <hi>Doge</hi> goes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him at his <hi>Gondalo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe particular Viſits, as alſo thoſe of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors upon extraordinary Occaſions, are made with the Permiſſion of the Senate, which is deſired at the <hi>College;</hi> for the <hi>Doge</hi> hath it not in his Power to ſee whom he pleaſes, and he lives ſo retired that one may ſay, Solitude and Dependance are the moſt Eſſential Qualities of his Condition; neither are theſe Viſits very agreeable to the <hi>Senate,</hi> who never give their Permiſſions, but for want of a civil Excuſe to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102922:91"/>
avoid it: The Count <hi>D' Avaux</hi> was the firſt that undertook to viſit the Doge <hi>Dominico Contarini,</hi> in his Sickneſs, to which the <hi>Senate</hi> conſented<hi>:</hi> In this Occaſion the Gentleman of the <hi>Doge,</hi> and ſome other Officers, are at the Landing-place of the Palace to conduct the Ambaſſadour to the <hi>Doge:</hi> The <hi>Senate</hi> are ſure in theſe Junctures to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually informed of the moſt inſignificant Words that paſs in the Diſcourſe. Altho the Marquis <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain,</hi> was vex'd for being preceded in the Viſit by Monſieur <hi>D' Avaux,</hi> yet he demanded leave of the <hi>Senate</hi> to ſee the <hi>Doge,</hi> eſteeming that an Advantage which few Ambaſſadors receive in the whole Courſe of their Employs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Doge</hi> can only give general Anſwers to Embaſſadors upon the Propoſitions they intend to exhibit to the <hi>College;</hi> for if he ſhould word it ſo as to bring the <hi>Senate</hi> into the leaſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; he would not only meet with the Confuſion of having it diſown'd, but would likewiſe expoſe himſelf to the moſt ſenſible Mortifications: However if the Propoſitions of an Embaſſador are prejudicial to the Dignity of the <hi>Republick,</hi> the <hi>Doge</hi> is not only ſupported in ſuch a Juncture, by anſwering in the Name of the <hi>Republick,</hi> with all the Rigour of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd Prince, but he is moreover oblig'd to act in that Nature, if he would not be eſteem'd unworthy of the Place he poſſeſſes. Upon the Audience of an Ambaſſador to acquaint the <hi>College</hi> with any Succeſs of his Maſters, or to congratulate the <hi>Republick</hi> upon the happy iſſue of their Affairs, the <hi>Doge</hi> hath at thoſe times
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102922:92"/>
the Liberty to anſwer more amply, but without ever entring into a particular.</p>
                     <p>The continual occaſion which the Doge <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minico Contarini</hi> had of expreſſing himſelf upon theſe Matters, had acquir'd him a mighty Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of making ſuch adequate Replies, and ſo proportion'd to the Subject, that no Prince was ever known to exceed him; nevertheleſs for having made ſome that did not ſeem to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently laid upon general terms, he was forc'd to ſuſtain in theſe Occaſions the moſt ſenſible Reprimands. It is not in theſe Audiences only that the <hi>Doge</hi> is oblig'd to have a care of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the limits preſcrib'd him, but it likewiſe behoves him to proportion the Steps of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: The Affair of Monſeignior <hi>Altoviti,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſour to Monſeignior <hi>Vareſe</hi> Nuncio to the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſeem'd a thing of no importance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Doge,</hi> yet it nevertheleſs made his <hi>Serenity</hi> extreamly ſenſible of the Miſery of his Condition.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Nuncio</hi> had demanded ſatisfaction of the <hi>College,</hi> for that contrary to the Privileege of Embaſſadors, the <hi>Grand Captain,</hi> or <hi>Provost,</hi> had ſeized one of his Retinue for carrying of Piſtols; the Perſon was Releas'd upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſur'd that he belong'd to the <hi>Nuncio;</hi> yet the <hi>Prelate</hi> was not contented with this ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but demanded ſomething more publick; and ſeeing the <hi>Senate</hi> was not diſpos'd to humour his Niceties, he publickly ſhew'd his Reſentments, by refuſing to aſſiſt at the Ceremonies of the <hi>Chappels,</hi> which the <hi>Doge</hi> very frequently holds, which is the only means that Embaſſadors have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102922:92"/>
of diſcovering their Diſcontents to the People, when they pretend not to have Juſtice done them, as they ought in reaſon to expect: And as the <hi>Senate</hi> does uſually receive this proceeding for a Mark of Contempt, and not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon ſuch frivolous Occaſions to let the People perceive the Miſunderſtanding, ſo they become more tractable and eaſier inclin'd to give ſatisfaction to the Miniſters, who ought to be aſſiſtant with the <hi>Seignory</hi> upon thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
                     <p>The great Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> was then approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at which time the <hi>Seignory</hi> goes for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Days together to the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> both in the Morning and Afternoon, which made the <hi>Senate</hi> unwilling to defer giving ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> that ſo obſtinately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear'd to his Pretenſions: However all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn was, That the <hi>Grand Captain</hi> who ſeiz'd the <hi>Perſon,</hi> was not to be aſſiſtant in attending the <hi>Doge</hi> upon three of thoſe Solemn Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; accordingly he appeared not at the firſt Ceremony of <hi>Tenebres, Holy Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> but he came upon <hi>Good-Friday</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Court of the <hi>Palace</hi> to march in his place: The <hi>Nuncio</hi> being in the Apartment where they aſſemble upon theſe Occaſions, was inform'd of it by ſuch as were to obſerve in what manner the Satisfaction was made; he complain'd at that very inſtant to the <hi>Doge,</hi> that they had contraven'd to the Aſſurances given him, proteſting that he would proceed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if that Officer was not ordered to go out of the Palace; inſomuch that the Prince believing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102922:93"/>
in good earneſt, that they had forgot the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſent his Orders for the <hi>Grand Captain</hi> to withdraw.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> however explain'd the Terms of this Satisfaction quite otherwiſe to what the <hi>Doge</hi> and <hi>Nuncio</hi> did; for they pretended that three different Functions at the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> were what the <hi>Nuncio</hi> had taken for the officiating of three diſtinct Solemn Feaſts; for which reaſon they equally reſented the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt the <hi>Doge,</hi> and the <hi>Captain,</hi> the one for Commanding, and the latter for having O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed contrary to his Duty: The Officer was thrown into a Priſon and ſeverely us'd, to give him the Knowledge of his Superiors<hi>:</hi> And one of the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> of State, who have as ample a Power of Life and Death over the Prince, as over the leaſt Gentleman of the <hi>Republick,</hi> made him ſo ſevere a Reprimand in minding of him that his Life was in their Hands, upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding any one to exceed his Duty; that the poor Prince burſt into Tears, regreating with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the Delights of the private Condition he enjoyed at his Country Seat before the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the III in acknowledgment of the Protection which the <hi>Republick</hi> ſhew'd him, and of the Singular Services of Prince <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian Ziani,</hi> preſented the Doge with the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Chair, the Cuſhion, and the <hi>Ombrelle</hi> of the ſame; as likewiſe the <hi>Tapers,</hi> the Standards and Trumpets, which are at preſent the chief part of the Pomp of theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
                     <p>Then the Doge comes between the Pope's <hi>Nuncio</hi> and the Embaſſador of <hi>France;</hi> If there were any Embaſſadors at <hi>Venice,</hi> as formerly there was and are now at <hi>Rome,</hi> they would march a Breaſt according to their places on each ſide of the <hi>Nuncio</hi> and Embaſſador of <hi>France:</hi> But ſince the <hi>Republick</hi> according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> decided the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeance of place in Favour of <hi>France</hi> againſt the Crown of <hi>Spain (Meſſire Francis de Nouailes</hi> being at that time Embaſſador to the <hi>Republick</hi> from <hi>Charles</hi> the IXth.) the Embaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> hath not appear'd at any of theſe <hi>Publick</hi> Functions, which is the Reaſon that he is leſs known and beloved at <hi>Venice</hi> than the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>France,</hi> who is commonly called by the People the Embaſſador, as if there was no other of that Character.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe Ceremonies the Doge wears a <hi>Veſt</hi> with ſtraight Sleeves, that reaches to the Ground, this is faſtned before by about a dozen large Vermillion Buttons that come to his Girdle, which claſps together with Buckles of Gold; over theſe is the long Ducal Cloak all which are of a Gold brouard, or Silver
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102922:95"/>
mix'd with Red or White according to the day of the Solemnity; the <hi>Ducal Cap</hi> is of the ſame Silk with a large border of Gold tiſhue, which repreſents the <hi>Diademe;</hi> his two <hi>Valets de Chambre</hi> hold the train of his Cloak and the eldeſt <hi>Ecuyer</hi> carrys the <hi>Ombrelle</hi> over his Head; which is very large rais'd like a Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion covered with Rich Gold brouard, round about it is a Campage, like that of the Popes.</p>
                     <p>The Councellors of the Doge follow two and two together, but the firſt is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Noble that is elected for the firſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſty or Government that comes vacant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the States of the <hi>Republick;</hi> he marches on the right hand of the Councellor carrying with both hands a large Sword in a Scabbard of Flowered Velvet covered with <hi>Vermillion Filagreen:</hi> This Sword is like that which the Pope Conſecrates every <hi>Chriſtmas Day;</hi> with a Hat of Black Velvet lined with <hi>Ermin,</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt embroider'd in <hi>Pearls</hi> upon the Head, which is ſent to that Chriſtian Prince who fights againſt the Enemies of the Church. That behind the Doge is the mark of the Dignity of great <hi>Ecuyer</hi> of the <hi>Eaſtern Empire,</hi> which was conferr'd upon the Doge <hi>Peter Gradenigo</hi> by the <hi>Emperor Michael,</hi> which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Doges poſſeſt after him; for if this Sword was carried after the Prince, and at the Head of the <hi>Seignory,</hi> it would repreſent the Senate to have the whole Authority, of which the <hi>Doge</hi> hath only for himſelf the ſhadow of that Greatneſs, whoſe Pomp and Trophies
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102922:95"/>
that precede him, are no more than a vain, and an imaginary appearance of Dignity.</p>
                     <p>The ſix Councellors of the <hi>Doge,</hi> are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the three Preſidents of <hi>the Council Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal of Forty,</hi> the two <hi>Avogadors,</hi> the three Chiefs of the <hi>Council of Ten,</hi> the two Cenſors, and ſeveral Senators marching two and two in the Ducal Veſt of Purple, very large, and the Sleeves as wide as the Veſt is long. The <hi>Doge</hi> attracts with this Train both the Admiration and Veneration of the People, who are much delighted in theſe Ceremonies, where they all continually implore the Benediction of the Almighty upon his Perſon, knowing well that although they have ſometimes reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt the Rigours of the Government, yet it is not the * Prince who is the occaſion of them, notwithſtanding that ſuch Publications are made in his Name.</p>
                     <p>When the Proceſſion is in this manner come to the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> the <hi>Doge</hi> places him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the firſt Seat at the Right Hand of the Entrance into the Church; the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> are on his ſide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving any void ſpace of Reſpect from him; the Counſellors ſit on the ſame ſide, and in the ſame Row, but at ſome diſtance from them: All the chief Perſons aſſiſting in theſe Ceremonies with the <hi>Doge</hi> and <hi>Counſellors,</hi> are ſeated on the ſame ſide upon two rows of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; the Senators, who here repreſent the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> are on the other hand; however they equally ſhare in this Honour with the <hi>Doge,</hi> by receiving the ſame Ceremony of the <hi>Pax</hi> and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102922:96"/>
                        <hi>Incenſe,</hi> which is to inform the Publick, that they do not appear at theſe Functions to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and grace the Train of their Prince, but that they are equally with him the Eſſential Members of the Body of the <hi>Republick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Ceremonies are over, the <hi>Doge</hi> goes back attended in the ſame manner to the Palace: The <hi>Nuncio</hi> and the <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> bring him to the bottom of the Stairs, where they take leave of his <hi>Serenity:</hi> But inſtead of reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at that inſtant, they fall off to the right Hand, where they ſtand until the laſt Senator is paſt by them. This Cuſtom which ſeems ſo very repugnant to the Dignity of Embaſſadors, was firſt introduced by the <hi>Nuncio of a Pope,</hi> who ſoliciting the <hi>Senate</hi> upon ſome important Affair, was pleas'd to compliment theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen with this mark of Civility: But the <hi>Republick,</hi> who is ſo well vers'd in drawing Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from all Accidents, will never admit of any Overtures to aboliſh a Cuſtom ſo very acceptable to them; for according to their real Maxims, the Senators are thereby as much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd as the <hi>Doge,</hi> by the Miniſters of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe publick Ceremonies are chiefly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the happy Diſcoveries of ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, or upon ſome Sedition appeas'd, the gaining of a Victory, or ſome other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the State, in which Accidents the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> does much affect to ſhew their Piety and Acknowledgments by theſe <hi>Publick Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings</hi> they offer up to the <hi>Almighty;</hi> which Functions are become ſo frequent, that with

                     <p>BEFORE they proceed to the Choice of a New <hi>Doge,</hi> they perform the laſt Duties to the Deceas'd with all the Magnificence due to the Condition of his Station; his Body is Embalm'd, which lies in State for three Days together, in a great Room, upon a Bed of Cloath of Gold, where the Sword, and Spurs are by a very particular Cuſtom laid the wrong way. However the occaſion of the Body's lying in this manner, is not only to give the People an opportunity of rendring their laſt Reſpects to the Prince, but it is particularly to receive ſuch Complaints as may be made againſt his Conduct and Adminiſtration of Affairs, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo time for the Creditors to call for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which his Heirs are oblig'd to pay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, or to have the Deceas'd depriv'd of the Funeral Honours, the Charges whereof the <hi>Republick</hi> defrays.</p>
                     <p>For which reaſon, the firſt thing entred upon after the Death of the <hi>Doge,</hi> is to chooſe three <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> to examine into his Conduct, to hear ſuch Complaints as may be made againſt his way of Living, and to do Juſtice to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

Demands at the Expence of the Inheritance, whereby the Miſery of the Subjection in which he lived, appears not to ceaſe with his Life. It even looks as if the <hi>Republick</hi> would moderate the ſatisfaction which the <hi>Doge</hi> might poſſibly have by dying, in hopes of being regreated by the Publick, for the Senate aſſiſts at this Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pomp in Veſts of Scarlet, to ſhew the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Singularity of this Ceremony, that it is not the Government of the Prince which compoſes the Happineſs of the State; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the <hi>Republick</hi> being free, ought not to ſhew any Marks of Affliction at his Death.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Obſequies</hi> of the <hi>Doge</hi> are no ſooner over, but a Great Council of all the <hi>Nobility</hi> above Thirty is held, where they chooſe five Perſons who are to draw up the Heads of the Inaugural Oath; that is, the Laws which he ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwears to obſerve upon his Election: Theſe Nobles are empowered to add, or retrench from them as they ſhall judge neceſſary for the good of the <hi>State,</hi> by which means the <hi>Republick</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives the Doge of explaining to their diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the terms of theſe Obligations, which compoſe an in the Volume.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt thing the <hi>Doge</hi> does upon his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after the uſual Oaths of obſerving the Statutes, is to ſhew himſelf to the People: But as the <hi>Republick</hi> does not permit him the Taſte of pure Joys, without the Reliſh of ſome Bitterneſs, which may make him, ſenſible of the Reſtraint and Servitude to which his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition engages him, ſo they bring him down through the Hall, where his Body is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd after his Death: Here he is compliment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102922:98"/>
upon his Exaltation by the <hi>Great Chancellour,</hi> to the end he may remember that in this place he ſhall be Examin'd when he is Dead, if he hath quadrated all his Actions according to the Rules of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>The Doge after this goes into a ſort of an Engine, which they call a <hi>Well,</hi> that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely kept in the <hi>Arcenal</hi> for the uſe of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. It really hath the external reſemblance of a <hi>Well</hi> Supported by a wooden frame like a Litter, but of an Extraordinary length; the two ſides of whoſe ends are joyn'd together. About two hundred men belonging to the <hi>Arcenal</hi> carry this Engine upon their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Doge ſitting in this Well, with one of his Children or neareſt Relations, ſtanding upright behind him, who hath two Baſons full of Gold and Silver medals, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely coin'd for this occaſion, with ſuch figures and Inſcriptions as he thinks fit, which he throws among the People, whilſt the Doge is carrying round about the place of Saint <hi>Mark.</hi>

                     <p>The cuſtom of beſtowing theſe Liberalities upon the People was firſt Introduced in the Year 1172, by the Famous Doge <hi>Sebaſtian Zia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> that Triumph'd over the <hi>Emperor Frederick</hi> the ſecond, by taking <hi>Otho,</hi> Son of this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Priſoner, in the Naval Victory he obtain'd over him in the defence of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third. The Doge thought it Neceſſary to ſhew this Liberality to the People, as the ſweeteſt charm and the moſt proper remedy to allay their indignation for being depriv'd of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102922:98"/>
their Right of Electing the Prince, which they had alone enjoyed for ſeveral Ages. This Doge was moreover ſo Rich that he built at his own proper charge all the old Procurato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, leaving beſides very immenſe Riches to the Church of Saint <hi>Mark:</hi> Inſomuch, as it was commonly believed among the People, that he had found ſome mighty Treaſure.</p>

There are ſo many Councellors as there are Quarters in the City, but a Noble that lives in one Ward or quarter cannot be Councellor for another; for every Councellor is the chief man of the Ward: Although they are call'd Councellors of the Doge yet they are in reality Councellors of the Seignory; For which Reaſon they have a greater Power than the Doge himſelf, ſeeing they can do that without him, which he can only do by their preſence: They are cloath'd in Red and wear the <hi>Ducal Veſt</hi> with great wide Sleeves all the while they are in Office; whereas the Preſidents of the Criminal of Forty, wear the violet veſt according to the common cuſtom with narrow Sleeves.</p>
                     <p>They adviſe together upon the heads they are to propoſe to the <hi>Great Council;</hi> yet a Councellor of the Seignory may alone make a propoſition to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and the <hi>Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;</hi> which the Preſidents of the Criminal of Forty cannot do unleſs they all three agree in Opinion. Theſe Preſidents are however Treated with the Tittle of excellency, as likewiſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nobles who enter into the great Employs. Nevertheleſs the rank of <hi>Preſident of the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Forty,</hi> is only conſiderable for the entrance it gives them into the <hi>College</hi> and <hi>Pregadi.</hi> Therefore theſe Employs are uſually poſſeſs'd by the Nobles of the Families, the narrowneſs of whoſe affairs oblige them to ſeek theſe Offices attended with Salaries, for the more convenient ſupport of their Quality.</p>

                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102922:99"/>
The <hi>Councellors of the Seignory</hi> can aſſemble a Great Council Extraordinary; for out of the <hi>College</hi> they exerciſe in that Council the greateſt part of their <hi>Functions:</hi> although the <hi>Pregadi</hi> hath a nomination to this Dignity, and the great Council the ſame; yet the firſt have ever the Preference in the Great Council, who in this matter reſpect the Elections of the Senate; not but that they can depoſe them from their places; which lately happened to one of the worthieſt Senators of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; however by the Laws of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>a Noble cannot be depriv'd of his Charge witout trying of him, or providing for him with another Employ;</hi> ſo one of his ill affected Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren nominated him for one of the moſt inconſiderable Governments of the State, which are given only among the pooreſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.

                     <p>As the <hi>Republick</hi> is never without the Doge, nor the Seignory without their Preſident, ſo the ancienteſt Councellor aſſumes the buſineſs when he is ſick, or the place vacant; whom he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents in the Adminiſtrations of all affairs; he marches among the Ambaſſadors in publick Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and anſwers to their Audiences in the College; yet he never ſits in the Ducal Seat, neither doth he aſſume the habit of <hi>Doge,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing himſelf only by the <hi>Cap</hi> which he never takes from his head, but keeps it on as the <hi>Doge</hi> doth the <hi>Ducal Horn.</hi>

with much ſilence gives an extraordinary Attention, altho very few among them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Foreign Languages, of which <hi>French</hi> is the moſt known of all.

                     <p>The Senate finds their account by treating in this manner the Miniſters of Princes; for they avoid entring into the particular Reaſons of the Debates, and likewiſe evade the Difficulties which the Arguments of an Embaſſador might alledge againſt the Motives that induc'd the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to take ſuch a different Reſolution from what was in reaſon expected of them. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that an Embaſſador is here engag'd with the Deaf and the Dumb, he is oblig'd to take his Anſwer without ever confering with the <hi>Sages,</hi> wherein he might probably make uſe of ſuch Arguments as might engage them to alter their Sentiments; for which reaſon <hi>Venice</hi> may be ſaid to be the <hi>School of Embaſſadors;</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs where the Opportunities of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring much Experience and Perfection in things of this Nature, are infinitely more rare, than

the Occaſions of ſhewing the extraordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Perſons employed in this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy.</p>

                     <p>The late Count <hi>D'Avaux</hi> ſhew'd his great Ability and conſummate Prudence in the time of his <hi>Embaſſy,</hi> that continued five Years; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which the <hi>Affairs of Mantua,</hi> and the <hi>Siege of Caſal,</hi> gave frequent Opportunities to ſeveral very delicate and important <hi>Treaties:</hi> to the Dexterity and frequent <hi>Good Offices</hi> of that <hi>Able Miniſter,</hi> are owing the greateſt part of thoſe Vigorous Reſolutions which the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> took in favour of the <hi>Duke of Nevers,</hi> and to ſupport him in the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Mantua.</hi> It was in managing the Sentiments of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that he ſhewed himſelf capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>the greateſt Negotiations,</hi> as likewiſe of the <hi>Principal Offices</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> of which he ſo worthily acquited himſelf afterwards.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> does always affect to avoid ſaying <hi>NO,</hi> in her <hi>Negative Anſwers,</hi> this <hi>Expreſſion</hi> being thought too hard, and too much diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102922:109"/>
for which reaſon, when they do not concur to the demands of an Embaſſador, they uſe ſuch a Circumference of fine words, that one would almoſt imagine they frequently grant the thing that is denied in Effect. But when they admit of the demand, they elevate the Favour to all its Degrees and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; inſomuch, that what ſeem'd a Trifle, and not worth the Trouble of Asking, appears then a Favour of the greateſt importance. It is certain, there is no people in the world that do expreſs themſelves with more Addreſs in theſe Junctures; in which manner of writing lies the great Ability of the Secretaries to the Senate.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>College</hi> receives the Miniſters of all Princes, according to the Degrees of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the Characters they bring: The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> are received at their firſt Audience with open Doors, and have the ſame place with thoſe from Crowned Heads; but the <hi>College</hi> does not riſe and uncover themſelves, until they come to the middle of the Hall, where they make the Second Reverence. <hi>Envoys Extraordinary,</hi> and <hi>the Receiver of Malta,</hi> who is <hi>Minister of the Order,</hi> are received alſo with open Doors; they are placed next to the Sages of <hi>Terra firma,</hi> and ſpeak covered. <hi>Reſidents</hi> are treated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Ceremony; they ſpeak ſtanding and uncovered, at the bottom of the ſteps where the Seats of the Seignory are raiſed.</p>
                     <p>When an Ambaſſador goes to his Audience no Body comes from the College to receive
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102922:109"/>
him at his <hi>Gondalo,</hi> nor to the ſtairs to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce him, which is contrary to the cuſtom of all other Courts: But when an Embaſſador comes to the Palace to aſſiſt in ſome <hi>Publick Function,</hi> the Gentleman of the Doge, goes to receive him and conducts him to the Doge, or into the Hall of the College where they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſſemble before they go to the Ceremony. Notwithſtanding that the Affairs which an Embaſſador Treats of in his Audience, are in themſelves more important, conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard more the Glory of the Prince; than the preſence of a Miniſter is neceſſary at ſome ſolemnities of devotion; yet he is here in theſe laſt occaſions treated with more honour.</p>
                     <p>Although an Embaſſador demands Audience of the College the day before his coming, and the hour is appointed; yet the College is uſually ſo far from being ready to receive him; that the Embaſſador is ſometimes oblig'd to wait a quarter of an hour at the door. This cuſtom was introduc'd (as theſe Gentlemen ſay) to the end ſuch Miniſters may have time to repoſe themſelves, after coming up the ſteps, and to repaſs in their thoughts the buſineſs they are to ſpeak upon in the College; this being ſo neceſſary that an Embaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> complained of the doors being opened at his coming, for he was ſo out of Breath and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs'd that he was not able to expreſs a word of what he had to ſay. For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Embaſſadors expecting it upon the day of their firſt Audience, take the neceſſary Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by aſcending very ſlowly up to the College.</p>

The Doge does not uncover himſelf upon the <hi>Publick</hi> Audiences of Embaſſadors<hi>:</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they give for it, is becauſe the Horn is the Crown of the Doge who takes it not off at Maſs but at the Elevation: Nevertheleſs the Councellor that acts as <hi>Vice Doge</hi> obſerves the ſame thing upon the abſence of the Prince, neither doth he ſo much as make a ſign of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his hand to his Cap, when an Embaſſador makes him at three ſeveral times three profound Reverences. However the Doge takes off his Horn to the Cardinals that come to their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the ſame to the Princes of Royal Blood, as was obſerv'd when the late Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was at <hi>Venice.</hi> At the beginning of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy <hi>Monſieur D'avaux.</hi> perceiving at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he came to the door, that the College did not riſe ſoon enough to receive him, ſtopp'd ſhort at the entrance.

All the Members of the College, thoſe of the Council of Ten, the Forty Judges of the Council Criminal and all the Procurators of Saint <hi>Mark</hi> have entrance into the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> as likewiſe the greateſt part of the Magiſtrates of the City: whereby this aſſembly of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> may amount unto about Two Hundred and Fourſcore Gentlemen, part of them hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliberative voices; others are only there to obſerve and form themſelves to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>The Doge, the Councellors of the Seigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the Great Sages, are the only Perſons whoſe Opinions can be Ballotted, which is to avoid the confuſion that would proceed from the diverſity of ſentiments in ſo great an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſembly; where the Opinions cannot paſs if they have not one half of the voices. Yet thoſe who have not the right of voting, may harangue in the defence or againſt the Opinions propoſed. As the Sixſcore ordinary and extraordinary <hi>Senators</hi> are every year Ballotted in the great Council, to be chang'd or continu'd as this aſſembly thinks neceſſary; ſo the deſire which every one of them have to be continued in the condition that is ſo very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and the fear of being deprived of it by the great Council that never ſpares any Body; inviolably engages them to the Duty of their Employs, and prevents them from making any ill uſe of their Authority.</p>
                     <p>No body can imagine but that there muſt be great Inconvenience's to be feared, ſeeing all affairs are regulated by the plurality of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102922:111"/>
Voices; more eſpecially becauſe they are made by balls that are thrown into boxes which the Secretaries carry about the <hi>Hall;</hi> ſome of which are mark'd with the word YES, and the other NO, the laſt are deſigned for the balls of ſuch that equally reject both <hi>pro</hi> and the <hi>contra,</hi> which are called the <hi>Non Suceres;</hi> for as theſe Votes are given ſo, as it ſhall not be diſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh'd what any one hath done, ſo ſuch a perſon is oftentimes of an Opinion that he durſt not own if he was to declare himſelf publickly.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the multitude of Senators in the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> there are ſome very Ignorant, who are only introduc'd hither in honour of their Age and Family; There are others very poor, who may be liable to err from the Right way; Neither is there any want of thoſe Old fellows, who have any other knowledge than that of their Ancient Cuſtomes, theſe are the Opinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that never acommodate their Judgments to the various Junctures of time, and who regard Novelty as a Crime againſt the State. Inſomuch that the Senate muſt be often Subject to fall upon thoſe Reſolutions which would not be ever conformable to the real Intereſts of the <hi>Republick,</hi> if the moſt able heads of this Body who are Senſible of the defects, did not prevent theſe inconveniency's by another, that ſome times ruines their affairs; which is by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing, that ſo in time and by the force of their Speeches, they may prevail upon their Sentiments, to give the true motion to theſe important affairs.</p>

Secrecy is rarely to be found in a multitude that abounds with Youth and Poverty; it is therefore much to be admir'd how it becomes inviolable at <hi>Venice;</hi> ſeeing the Examples of ſuch who have ſold it to the Miniſters of Great Princes, are not at all conſiderable in Number: but the <hi>Republick</hi> hath provided againſt it by the power ſhe hath given the Inquiſitors of State to puniſh the Guilty, as ſhall be obſerv'd hereafter; and by the oaths that are renewed ſo often as they enter upon any matter of the laſt importance, as likewiſe by the excluſion of all ſuch as have any relation with the Court of Rome, when the affairs lyes that way, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever far the affinity or dependance is diſtant; for the Senate is not Satisfied with excluding all <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> from the Government, but they even diſtruſt their Fathers and neareſt Allied, inſomuch that when any thing is there agitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which may any ways concern the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is Publickly cried in the <hi>Pregadi, Fuora Papalini,</hi> that is for all ſuch as have Children, or Brothers provided with benefices, or other <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> dignities, to withdraw themſelves, at that inſtant, leaſt the Secret of the State ſhould be made known to foreign Princes,</p>

                     <p>All the Venetian Gentlemen of five and twenty and that have aſſum'd the Veſt may enter into the Great Council and claim the Right of balloting, that is, of Voting: To gratifie moreover the young Nobility of twenty, thirty of them are drawn by lot who have the ſame priviledge with thoſe of five and twenty: This ceremony is obſerv'd upon the day of St. <hi>Barbara,</hi> ſo the thirty which Fortune
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102922:113"/>
hath particularly favour'd from the Names of all the reſt in the Urne, are called <hi>Barbarini.</hi> The <hi>Republick</hi> hath often times beſtowed this privilege upon the Children of ſuch Nobles as have very eminently ſerved the State in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular juncture; during the War diſpenſations of Age were ſold at two hundred Ducates: this Sum is no ways conſiderable, in regard of the advantages, that are acquired by the entrance into the Great Council; which rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers theſe Nobles of the Body of the <hi>Republick,</hi> who by the right of <hi>Balloting,</hi> are received into the ſame conſideration, with the other more ancient Members of the State.</p>
                     <p>The Great Council aſſembles all <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holidays</hi> excepting that of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and thoſe of the Virgin: This Council is not to continue their ſitting after it is dark; in Summer they begin at Eight in the Morning and ſit until twelve; in the Winter they ſit from twelve to Sun-ſet; after which time no propoſitions can be made in that place, inſomuch that ſuch as are begun and cannot be expedited before theſe Limits elapſe, are balloted again in the next Seſſion as if they ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

This Aſſembly is held in the Largeſt Hall of the Palace, there is at the bottom of it a ſort of a Throne like to that in the <hi>College,</hi> upon which the Doge and the Councellors of the Seignory take their places. The Preſidents of the Council of Ten, the <hi>Avogadors</hi> and the <hi>Cenſors</hi> ſit upon raiſ'd benches in the Hall, they being to take care that the Nobles may do nothing contrary to the order of the Statutes.</p>

The greateſt Aſſemblies of the Great Council are rarely above ſix hundred Gentlemen, who ſit upon benches plac'd in rows along the Hall; but there are as many more that have right of entrance, who are either employed in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, or upon ſome other occaſions of abſence do not appear at the Council. As the Great Sages may Summon an Extraordinary Senate, ſo the Councellors of the Signory have power of Aſſembling the Great Council, ſo often as the multitude of Employs to diſtribute, or the urgency of buſineſs ſhall require it. To which purpoſe a bell is rung which they call the <hi>Trotiere;</hi> this is anſwered by the five principal bells in the five other Wards of the City, at which Signal the Nobility never fail of appearing at the Council, where the wearing of Arms is forbidden upon pain of Death, and to be immediately thrown out of the Windows, leaſt the heats in Balloting might Chance to occaſion ſome diſorders. For which reaſon they leave their <hi>Stiletto's</hi> in their <hi>Gondalo's,</hi> as likewiſe ſuch other Arms as they uſually wear in all other places.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecurity of this Aſſembly, againſt which, the Hiſtory of <hi>Venice</hi> mention ſeveral Conſpiracies, that were formely laid, with the Intention of deſtroying the whole Body of Nobility at once; they place guards at all the chief entrances into the Palace and the others are kept ſhut. In which occaſions they make uſe of the Artificers and Workmen of the Arcenal, who are the faithfulleſt Subjects of the <hi>Republick.</hi> And as this Council is only held
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102922:114"/>
upon <hi>Holydays,</hi> to the end that all the Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates may be preſent, ſo the Works of the Arcenal are thereby no ways retarded. This <hi>Militi a</hi> is under the Command of the Procurat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> not only by Reaſon they are Perſons of the greateſt Authority; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe becauſe they do not go to the Great Council, as being above all Magiſtracy's there diſtributed; or poſſibly being they are exempt of the paſſive ſuffrage, ſo they ought not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the active.</p>
                     <p>They never propoſe diſtribution of above nine Employs in a Seſſion, by reaſon of the Cuſtom of having the Names of the Electors that Nominate the Parties to be decided by Chance; leaving it to either merit or faction to diſpoſe of it afterwards, in favour of one of the four Nobles which the Electors have choſen for the Execution of each Office. Yet that there may only be Six and Thirty Electors among all the Nobility then preſent, this method is obſerved in the manner of drawing the Lots.</p>
                     <p>There is placed on each ſide the Throne of the Seignory, over againſt the two laſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, two high and deep Cups, into which they may reach their hands but cannot ſee which to chooſe; the Secretaries count ſo many balls as there are Nobles in the Aſſembly, which number is divided into the two Cups, in each whereof there are moreover thirty gilt balls; the others are white. At the feet of the Doge there ſtands a third Cup, in which there is the ſame Number of balls
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102922:114"/>
as there are Gilt ones in the other two, that is Sixty, of which thirty ſix only are Gilt. After this the Nobles being call'd by a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary according to the Benches they ſit on, come two and two together to draw each of them a ball, out of the Cup on the ſide they are of; if it is white they throw it away, if a gilt one the Gentleman ſhews it and gives it the Councellor next the Cup, then advancing to the Doge draws one of the ſixty balls, if he Pitches upon a gilt one, he is of the Number of Electors, that have the diſtribution of the Charge, but if it is white he retires to his place.</p>
                     <p>After there are Nine Electors made in this manner, they withdraw with a Secretary into a ſeparated Room from the Council, where after they have drawn Lots for their places, he that is the firſt, Nominates a Noble for the firſt of the Employs that is to be given, the others do the ſame according to the places of their Lots; Theſe Nine Electors do then bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot one after another the Nine Nobles elected, he that hath not ſix Balls is excluded; and he that is Nominated continues until there is one that hath ſix of the Suffrages.</p>
                     <p>When Nine other Electors are by Lot drawn in the Great Council, they are to proceed in the ſame method, by Nominating and Ballot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nine ſeveral Nobles for the ſame Nine Employs, which is thus obſerved until the Six and Thirty Electors drawn into four ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodys of Nine each, have elected Thirty Six Gentlemen, that is four to each Employ,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102922:115"/>
upon which they are Balloted one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Great Council; he of the four ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving moſt Balls, ſtands provided with the Employ to which he was Named.</p>
                     <p>To accompliſh theſe Ballotations with the leſs loſs of time, there are a great many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Hoſpital of <hi>Foundlings,</hi> who carry in a Bag little Balls of ſtuff about the bigneſs of a Haſil Nut; they have likewiſe in their hands a Box, ſomewhat reſembling to that which collects the Suffrages of the <hi>Senate,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting in theſe there are only two diſtinct places, one for the <hi>YEA</hi>'s the other for the <hi>NO</hi>'s, there being no doubtful or indifferent voices in the diſtribution of the Employs, as there are for the uncertain ones of the Various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions upon the affairs of State. Theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren go up and down the Hall, crying alloud the Name of the Noble balloted. But this way of balloting is manag'd with ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion by the Children, that carry the boxes Tumultuouſly to and again, as likewiſe with ſo little dignity by the Nobles who ſome times unheedingly drop their Balls in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unconcernedly about the Hall; in the whole this want of order is highly undecent and altogether oppoſite to the Gravity, that ought to be inſeparable to ſuch an Illuſtrious Aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral <hi>Senators</hi> diſpers'd about the Hall, to take care that no abuſes may be committed in the <hi>Ballotations,</hi> yet it is impoſſible for them to be ſure that a Noble ſhall not take two Balls, being the long entrance of the box
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102922:115"/>
intirely hides the hand, yet it is purpoſely ſo contrived, to the end they may throw the ball into which ſide they pleaſe, without being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: therefore to give ſeveral balls to ſerve a friend, or to injure an Enemy, is forbidden upon the penalty of being for ever excluded the Council, which is the ſame thing with being deprived of Nobility, as hath ſometimes happened.</p>
                     <p>In theſe <hi>Ballotations</hi> the party's of the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are almoſt ever the ſtrongeſt, eſpecially when the matter in debate is for the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a <hi>Senator,</hi> either by not continuing him in his Dignity at the end of the year, or by fetching a Noble out of the great Employs of the Seignory, to execute one of the leaſt conſiderable Offices in the State, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, for not having regulated his conduct according to their ſentiments. In the Great Council hatred and Enmity put in Practice all the Artifices of revenge: it is there that Diſſimulation reigns in the full height, where not being Liable to be detected of falſehood, they uſually proteſt to the Excluded all the good offices of ſincere Friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding that theſe ſecret ways of ſatisfying their paſſions, are attended with no other effect than that of preventing the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from carrying their reſentments higher; yet this advantage is very conſiderable to a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick;</hi> which can apprehend nothing ſo much as the diviſion of her principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but the reciprocal dependance in which the Great Council keeps the Nobles, and the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102922:116"/>
continual fear of ſeeing themſelves Balloted to the prejudice, of their Intereſt and Honours, does not only oblige them to obſerve the neceſſary meaſures of living well with each other, at leaſt, apparently in a perfect good underſtanding; but theſe conſiderations do moreover inſpire them with a real Zeal and an intire attachement to the good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which are the moſt aſſured meanes for a Nobleman to attain the principal Employs of the <hi>Republick,</hi> as likewiſe to acquire the eſteem and affection of his equals, if he any ways ſtudies their good Opinions.</p>
                     <p>All the <hi>Ballotations</hi> of the great Council are perform'd in a manner before the eyes of the <hi>Publick,</hi> for the doors are not only open, but there is likewiſe an elevated bench for ſuch Strangers who come out of curioſity to ſee theſe Gentlemen paſs their Suffrages; but as the Nobles that come to the Great Council are permitted to ſpeak their ſentiments upon the things propoſed by the Councellor for the week (according to the cuſtom of the Sage for the week in the <hi>Senate,)</hi> or to give his Opinion upon any other important matter of State; ſo in theſe occaſions all ſtrangers are oblig'd to go out, that they may not enter into the Cogniſance of thoſe things that belong to the Nobility only.</p>
                     <p>There is in the Hall of the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil a ſort of a chair which is deſign'd for the uſe of ſuch as harangue in the aſſembly; it was there that <hi>Marc Attonio Cornaro,</hi> more than a Year after the loſs of <hi>Candia,</hi> made an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

Speech upon the Surrender of that place, where by the ſtrength of his Arguments he brought the <hi>Senate</hi> at that inſtant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon the Trial of <hi>Francis Moroſini</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General, who delivered it to the <hi>Turks;</hi> and he made <hi>Avogador,</hi> to give the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and proſecute the matter, that was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who made the accuſation.</p>

He endeavour'd at firſt to gain time, and to aſſure himſelf of what votes he could in the Great Council, by diſtributing large Summs of Money among the Poor Nobility, who are at <hi>Venice</hi> called <hi>Barnaboti,</hi> being moſt of them live in the Ward or Quarter of Saint <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;</hi> he likewiſe contriv'd it ſo that the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier Johannes Sagredo</hi> made there an excellent Speech in his behalf, wherein he ſhewed the weakneſs of the Accuſer, who could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the force of his Reaſons, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was thought not to be the Author of that harangue he pronounc'd againſt this General. Yet this did not hinder them from ſuspecting that the <hi>Chevelier Sagredo</hi> was well rewarded for the trouble; as likewiſe his Son after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in another caſe, for having maintain'd a bad cauſe in the <hi>Senate</hi> in conſideration of

It was firſt of all erected in the Year 1310; to reſtore the loſt quiet and ſafety of the City, after the Famous enterpriſe of <hi>Bajamonte Tie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polo</hi> in oppoſition to thoſe alterations which the Doge <hi>Peter Gradenigo</hi> had made in the Government; but as they perceived this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal was of an extraordinary good effect towards the ſetling of this new method of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; ſo it was reſtabliſh'd upon ſeveral different occaſions, until at length it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed for ever, being then five and twenty Years after the firſt Eſtabliſhing of it. The Doge comes with his ſix Councellors to this Council where he preſides; yet the <hi>Senators</hi> that compoſe it have not a leſs power in the abſence of the Doge, than if he was preſent with his Six Councellors.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Dignities are executed by Nobles of the firſt order, who are to be all Ten of ſo many different families; They are every year choſen by the Great Council; theſe elect three from among themſelves to be Preſidents, who are chang'd every three Months, during which theſe Preſidents take their turns by Weeks. He that is for the week receives all Memorials, Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the Reports of Spyes, which he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to his Collegues, who upon the depoſitions of Witneſſes and the anſwers of the Accuſed that are kept in diſmal Priſons, proceed to the Trials of the Guilty; they are the Accuſers before the Council, but the Accuſed are neither permitted by Council or in their own perſons to defend themſelves; this method is not only ſomething <hi>Barbarous,</hi> but likewiſe ſeverity is inſeparable to this <hi>Tribunal,</hi> whereby the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102922:119"/>
Nobility are the more uneaſy under this dreadful Authorty, as they are directly Subjected to it.</p>
                     <p>The Council of Ten is held only once a week, but the Preſidents may aſſemble it upon any urgency of affairs. It is to be ſeen in the Hiſtories of the <hi>Republick</hi> that the Council of Ten hath in ſeveral occaſions made Treaties of peace and alliance, Independently from the <hi>Senate,</hi> but this power does not now extend ſo far. As it belongs to this Council to provide for all things neceſſary to the ſafety of the <hi>Republick,</hi> ſo there are in the Arcenal both <hi>Cannon</hi> and <hi>Gallies</hi> to be diſpos'd of by this <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal;</hi> that which lyes always ready Arm'd over againſt the Place of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is under their command. And the better to oppoſe any Sudden attempt or Conſpiracy, the Council of Ten hath a little Arcenal in the Palace, as hath been obſerv'd, near the Hall of the Great Council.</p>
                     <p>One ſees in this Arcenal a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Arms of all ſorts, ſome ſmall <hi>Cannon</hi> that may be diſcharg'd ſeveral times, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a great many other <hi>curious</hi> pieces of this Nature; the fire Arms are in a Chamber over the others, among which there are always Six Hundred Muſquets ready charg'd, and a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Matches placed about a round Engine, which in an inſtant by the means of a Spring can be lighted all at once.</p>

                     <head>Of the Inquiſitors of State.</head>
                     <p>THE Tribunal of the Inquiſitors of State, is more formidable than can well be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; for as the buſineſs which is brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Lords, is the niceſt of all Criminal matters, even ſo is their ſeverity as much the more terrible; and their rigour inexorable, as their method of proceeding is extraordinary. The three places of <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> of the State are Executed by two <hi>Senators</hi> of the Council of Ten, and one of the <hi>Councellors</hi> of the Doge: Theſe three Lords have an abſolute Power of Life or Death over the Doge, the Nobles, Strangers, and even all the Subjects of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; without being oblig'd to ſhew any reaſons for what they do, or to Conſult with the Council of Ten, in caſe they are all three of an Opinion.</p>
                     <p>The Orders and Executions of this Tribunal are not leſs ſecret than their Judgments, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it is upon a Publick offence; but otherwiſe to avoid giving occaſion of exclaiming againſt ſo much ſeverity, that puniſhes with Death a word accidentally ſpoken by a miſerable wretch againſt their Rigorous Government; The Party offending is by Night ſent to the bottom of the Sea, without any other formality than confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with the two Witneſſes, if there are any, or elſe upon the report of their Spyes, of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102922:120"/>
which the City abounds. And by the help of theſe Penſionary Informers, thoſe mercileſs Judges have Eyes and Ears in all places, for which reaſon a Man accus'd to the Inquiſitors of State, is eſteem'd beyond Redemption, if his Innocency is not more clear than the Day.</p>
                     <p>As this way of proceeding with ſo little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and Juſtice, hath been ſometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by mighty Inconveniencies, ſo it is now enacted that the Inquiſitors of State ſhall not for the future put to Death a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing what he can ſay in his Juſtification. It may be Judg'd by this, what dangers ſuch Perſons incur as have no ſupport, and who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to fall into ſuch terrible hands; Seeing bare ſuſpicions in matters of State are puniſhed with more ſeverity at <hi>Venice,</hi> than the Crime it ſelf would be in any other place; eſpecially, when ſuch trifling things as carrying of Fire Arms, and an Hundred ſeveral others, of but equal moment to it, are made Crimes of State, which every where elſe could only be Contraventions to the Orders of the Civil Government.</p>
                     <p>The leaſt Infliction that a Stranger of any Conſideration hath to fear, upon any occaſion of being ſuſpected by the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> is an Order ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of the Magiſtrates, <hi>Strictly requiring him, upon pain of Death, to go out of the City and State within the ſpace of Twenty Four Hours.</hi> But as the Commands that are laid upon the Nobles, <hi>Not to have any Correſpondence with Embaſſadours, or other Miniſters of Princes, but likewiſe, upon pain of Death, are forbidden ſuch Commerces even with the moſt inconſiderable perſons of their</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:102922:120"/>
                        <hi>Families;</hi> ſo this is in relation of the niceſt and moſt ſuſpicious matters; for which reaſon, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Article, the <hi>Informers</hi> are moſt to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being the chiefeſt in their Inſtructions, and which they are moſt Vigilant in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>It is not much above Fifty Years that they firſt begun to obſerve this Severity in regard of the Nobility, to the end they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all Embaſſadors from penetrating into the Secrets of the State; but the terror which this dreadful <hi>Tribunal</hi> occaſions to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility is ſo exceſſive, that the Nobles themſelves have carried this order farther than it firſt was intended, leaſt they might be deem'd faulty by not ſufficiently clearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all manner of Suſpicion, in things where the State is ſo Jealous; inſomuch that if a <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentleman, whatever his condition may be in the <hi>Republick,</hi> ſhould happen to ſpeak to a Gentleman or Servant of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, in any Church or any other Publick Place by imagining him to be a ſtranger; and he afterwards coming to know whom it was he ſpoke to, he immediately runs and makes his confeſſion to the Inquiſitors of State, who are certain to admoniſh him to be more circumſpect, and to know whom it is he ſpeaks to for the future.</p>
                     <p>This order does not only regard the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity but likewiſe thoſe <hi>Citizens</hi> that wear the <hi>Veſt,</hi> and all Publick Officers are therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; conſequently all ſuch People of Faſhion as have any intimacy with the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102922:121"/>
think themſelves oblig'd neither to Viſit Embaſſadors or converſe with any of their <hi>Domeſticks,</hi> leaſt they might become ſuſpected, and occaſion the like to the Nobles they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; the Lawyers and particularly the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians are the only people wearing the <hi>Veſt,</hi> that are excepted in this Rigorous Law, by Reaſon of the abſolute neceſſity of their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; However this exception does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from uſing of the Liberty with a mighty Precaution.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Abbee Moro a Noble Venetian,</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from coming into the Great Council, as being a Benefic'd Perſon, was ſtrangled by order of the Inquiſitors for his ſecret Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Embaſſador of <hi>Spain. Nicolas Cornaro</hi> was taken ſometime afterwards maſqu'd in a <hi>Gondalo,</hi> where he was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with a Secretary of another Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Spain,</hi> he was Treated in the ſame Method: But the unfortunate <hi>Antonio Foſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> a Gentleman of Singular Merits, is a moſt tragical example of the terrible ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Inquiſitors upon theſe matters.</p>
                     <p>This Poor Gentleman was us'd to go every evening to a Courtiſane that lived near the houſe of the Spaniſh Embaſſador; one of his Enemies took the advantage of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ruin him, which was ſo much the more eaſy, as he was ſure to be believed, by informing of the Inquiſitors of State, that this Noble man kept a ſtrict correſpendence with the Embaſſador of a Nation, who for their divers attempts againſt the <hi>Republick,</hi> are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102922:121"/>
become much ſuſpected to the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The informer deſired he might have Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes aſſigned him for the proof of what he ſaid, and men to apprehend the accuſed upon his returning from the Embaſſadors Houſe; but to make his deteſtable enterpriſe ſucceed, he poſted a Man cloath'd in a Veſt that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled this Gentleman, and when he knew the Noble was at the Courtiſane's, he placed his Spies, and by the Glimmering Light of the Night ſhewed them the pretended Noble who effectually went into the Embaſſadors Houſe and came out at another door. The Spies immediately made their report of what they had ſeen; and the Inquiſitors to be better aſſur'd of the matter, order'd <hi>Foſcarini</hi> to be ſearch'd for at his Houſe, or where ever he was ſuppoſed to be; but not finding him, Orders were given to the accuſer to cauſe him to be ſeiſed upon, whereſoever he thought he might find him: So this unhappy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was apprehended in the Night about five and twenty ſteps from the Courtiſane's, the Sbirri's not daring to approach by day the Houſes of Embaſſadors, or to paſs through the Limits of their Jurſdiction without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing themſelves to the worſt of Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>This innocent man was immediately hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the priſons of the Inquiſitors, who without any other formality ſent him a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor and a Hangman; the Gentleman cried, Tormented himſelf and Proteſted himſelf In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent to the laſt degree, of all that could be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102922:122"/>
againſt him; the Confeſſor fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of his Innocence, thought himſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd in Conſcience to report his Opinion to the Inquiſitors; but they were deaf to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances and their ſentence was executed without Remiſſion; whereby this poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman became deſperate in his misfortune, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his Confeſſor, and was ſtrangled, dying perfectly mad upon ſuch inhuman uſage.</p>
                     <p>The execrable malice of the Informer lay hid until it was diſcovered by himſelf upon his death bed, who being forc'd through his anguiſh of conſcience declared the artifice he had uſed to ruin this Gentleman; but the Guilty could not be Puniſh'd in this Life, nor the Innocent Noble Juſtified but after his Death<hi>:</hi> Publick honours were made him, as likewiſe atonement to his Family, and his Son created Procurator of Saint <hi>Mark</hi> by Merit; to avoid falling for the future into the like Errors, it was enacted that the Inquiſitors ſhould not upon ſuch accuſations put to Death any Noble, without hearing what they had to ſay for themſelves.</p>
                     <p>This Tribunal never abates of her ſeverity, but alwayes puniſhes probable Suſpicions as the crime ſelf; theſe Rigorous Judges are pleas'd to order ſecret executions in thoſe Junctures, to avoid all clamours againſt an Authority that is already ſo odious to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; whereby ſuch a Perſon is ever reputed to have died by ſome chance or accident, who fell by the hands of the Executioners of their ſentences. It was for ſome time believed
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102922:122"/>
that the late <hi>Leonardo Loridan,</hi> unfortunately fell from the bridge of a <hi>Canal</hi> in the night, and knock'd out his brains againſt a boat that lay'd underneath it; but ſuch as knew that he was become Suſpected to the Inquiſitors of State, for frequenting the Houſe of a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſane where the <hi>Spaniſh Embaſſador</hi> ſometimes went, even after he had caution given him of it; do no ways doubt from whence came the blow, that deprived the <hi>Republick</hi> of one of the moſt Worthy and moſt eſteem'd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Venice.</hi>

                     <p>The greateſt Authority of theſe two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102922:123"/>
is that Power which they have of ſuſpending for three days the ſentences of all Tribunals, of the Colledge, Great Council, the Council of Ten as likewiſe the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of State, when the matter of fact is not a poſitive crime; but only the execution of the Ordinances which they can make in affairs of the State; inſomuch that they repreſent the ancient <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the <hi>Republick;</hi> their Authority is the ſame with thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Tribunes,</hi> for by interpoſing they ſuſpend all manner of Execution; yet they are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in three Days to produce their Reaſons for ſuch Interpoſitions, which ought to be ſo valid as to to cauſe another Deliberation upon thoſe Affairs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> chooſes the two <hi>Avogadors,</hi> who are to be afterwards approved of by the Great Council; they uſually give the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Offices to Perſons of known In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and of the firſt Families. They are not always the Richeſt of the Nobles, but are ever ſuch as are ſufficiently able to ſpeak in publick, whieh they have commonly acquir'd by their profeſſions of <hi>Barriſters</hi> at Law, which they have actualy followed, as do every day many of the Nobility, rather chooſing to ſupport themſelves by theſe honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means, which is thought no derogation, than by a thouſand baſe ſhifts that their quality gets off unpuniſhed. The Avogadors wear the <hi>Ducal Veſt</hi> of Violet, with the red Star, upon their uſual Functions, but they wear the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Veſt</hi> without the badge in the great in-be

                     <p>This <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> had Credit ſufficient, with his Two Collegues, to get his Project ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of; for which Reaſon, from that very day, all the Nobility were, upon great Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, forbidden the uſe of Perukes, with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to all ſuch who had begun to wear them, to forbear the continuance. It is no very difficult matter to imagine what a perplexity this Order occaſion'd to all the Young Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who were then ſo very curious in their Wiggs, that even ſuch as had very fine heads of Hair, preferr'd the acquired to their own; ſparing no Coſts to get thoſe that were beſt made; but the indiſpenſable neceſſity of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102922:124"/>
this Order of the Inquiſitors, oblig'd the greateſt part of the Nobility to retire into the Country, as not daring to appear in the City in the Conditions they were in.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Avogador Laurence Donat,</hi> being of the Number of them that wore Wigs, did ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe that they would not have leſs regard to the rank which his dignity gave him, than to the neceſſity which obliged him to it; he went to the Inquiſitor and uncovering his Head ſhewed him the condition he was in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting at the ſame time that the duty of his Employ engag'd him without any reſpite to the ſervice of the Republick, which made him hope he might be permitted to wear his <hi>Peruke;</hi> but ſeeing all the anſwers he could get were poſitively to the Negative of what he deſired; he then intimated to the Inquiſitor that by Vertue of the Red Srar which he wore on his Shoulder, he had power to Suſpend the execution of the Decree: this remonſtrance being expreſs'd with ſome heat, procur'd him an anſwer that intirely ſtopp'd his proceeding any farther in that matter; for the Inquiſitor made him remember, that by Vertue of his Office, he could have him thruſt into a Sack and ſent that night to repoſe in the Sea.</p>

                     <p>The Doge and his ſix Councellors of the Seignory did formerly preſide in the Criminal of Forty; but at preſent three only of theſe Councellors do preſide here for the four laſt Months of their year, which is to ſhew the affinity that there is between the College and

the Council criminal of Forty, who recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally know what paſſeth in theſe <hi>Tribunals,</hi> by the means of their principal Members. The <hi>Avogodors</hi> do often by their interpoſition ſend back to this Chamber, the deciſions of the College, Senate and other Sovereign Courts, which deciſions are in regard of caſes civil and criminal of private perſons, to be there re-exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, whoſe Sentences are ſometimes broke and made void: The Doge <hi>Peter Gradenigo</hi> got this <hi>Tribunal</hi> to paſs the <hi>La Parte,</hi> that is the Decree, which was the draught or Inſtrument of the <hi>Serrar del Conſiglio,</hi> that brought about the greateſt change of Government that ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this State.</p>
                     <p>The rich Nobility of the firſt Order would be glad to be Judges of the criminal of Forty, by reaſon of the great prerogatives belonging to them, but the ſtrict attendance which they are oblig'd to give for Eight Months to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Publick,</hi> is more than ſufficient to make moſt of them forbear the thoughts of it. Therefore theſe places are uſually poſſeſs'd by Nobles of the firſt and Second Orders, that Scruple not to attain unto theſe Employs, by others that are inferior to them, and the leſs being there are, beſides the advantage of Thirty <hi>Ducates</hi> a Month <hi>Salary,</hi> many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of bringing themſelves into conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation among the reſt of the Nobility, by the means of their entrance into the Senate, and ſeveral other advantages which their Offices give them of attaining the principal Employs.

of the merits that are acquir'd in this Office, make uſe of their utmoſt endeavors and deepeſt intrigues to attain unto this Magiſtacy, without paſſing the other two Councils of Forty, which are the uſual ſteps to that of the Criminal; but theſe Offices the rich Nobles infinitely eſteem beneath them.</p>

                     <p>When the Offender is in priſon, and his caſe ready to be heard, the <hi>Avogador</hi> orders it upon what day he pleaſes, at which time the Criminal is brought to the feet of the Judges, where he alledges all he can againſt him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerating
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102922:126"/>
the crime with all the Circumſtances that can render it odious; always concluding with the merits of a very vigorous pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment. In all theſe publick Actions, as likewiſe in the Speeches that are made in the Senate and in the Great Council, the Nobility and Lawyers are to ſpeak no other than the <hi>Venetian</hi> Language, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting in the Introductions of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, where they may make uſe of the pure <hi>Italian</hi> if they can, or otherwiſe this affectation would undoubtedly cauſe a ridiculous Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which muſt at length render them unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to the <hi>Publick.</hi> Beſides, the natural Language is moſt conſiſtent with the dignity of the Nation, which of late times is much improved in regard to what it was; for I have obſerved that in their Pleadings they affect a maſculine ſtile, which words and expreſſions have much of the Latin Tongue, and likewiſe ſeem to have a greater force and Energy than thoſe of the <hi>Tuſcan.</hi>

                     <p>After the Council hath ſpoke every body retires, and then they ballot the Opinion of the <hi>Avogadors,</hi> againſt that propoſed by the Judges, which is the moſt moderate, ſo the plurality of balls decides it; they do moreover de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine by ballotation all the Circumſtances of the Puniſhment, and in this manner theſe Judges paſs Sentence of Life and Death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being oblig'd to expreſs the Reaſon of their Opinions, or without knowing who is either for, or againſt the Criminal; as they are the Maſters and Sovereigns, ſo no Body examines if they have the Neceſſary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or taken their degrees in the Faculties of the Law, to render them Capable of theſe Judicatures. But they Judge according to their Laws, as do the Officers in an Army accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Military Statutes; their conſcience and their Natural Lights are the Principal Rules of their Judgment.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Inconveniency in the Juſtice of <hi>Venice,</hi> is the great length of time before they proceed to the Trials of Criminal Matters, uſually letting the offender Lie and Rot in their Miſerable Priſons, for to Expiate, as they ſay, ſome part of their Crime by this long Puniſhment: Yet what ſeems to me
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102922:127"/>
more Rigorous, are the frequent condmnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to dark Priſons, for Eight, Ten or more Years and often for Life; for the Hideouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Priſons which are almoſt under Water, is certainly ſomething more Terrible than Death it ſelf.

not being obliged to any manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
                     <p>As moſt of the Great Podeſtaries are very burthenſome, ſo the Gentlemen Nominated to them, do ſometimes rather chooſe to pay two thouſand Ducats and to be debarr'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Great Council for two years, than to accept thoſe Employs which are more Prejudicial to them than theſe Penalties, which the Laws impoſe upon ſuch as refuſe them; yet is is a very Surpriſing thing how ſome of theſe Podeſtats, as thoſe commonly ſent to <hi>Vicenza,</hi> who are ſcarce Thirty Years of Age, and who rarely have perform'd any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtudy or acquir'd further experience than what they have gained in the Intrigues and Ballotations of the Great Council, ſhould Judge and decide with ſo Singular a Prudence, the moſt important affairs relating to the Subjects of the Republick; It is true they always call to their Aſſiſtance Doctors of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law in the Cities of their reſidence, by whoſe advice they Regulate the deciſions of the more difficult caſes.</p>
                     <p>The Republick always ſends a Noble of the firſt order into the Province of <hi>Frivoli,</hi> with the title of Proveditor General of <hi>Nova Palma,</hi> which is the handſomeſt and moſt regular Place in all their Diminions upon <hi>Terra Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> it is a Frontier Town to the Emperor, and a mighty check againſt thoſe Incurſions that the <hi>Turks</hi> have frequently attempted on this ſide. At <hi>Dine</hi> which is the reſidence of the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Aquilea</hi> there is a <hi>Lieutenant</hi> and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102922:134"/>
ſome Subaltern Officers. In <hi>Iſtria</hi> of which <hi>Capo'd Iſtria</hi> is the Capital, there are four <hi>Epiſcopal Cities,</hi> and five leſs conſiderable, who have all Podeſtats. The Magiſtracies of <hi>Frivoli</hi> and <hi>Iſtria</hi> are for two years, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and the <hi>Iſles</hi> of the Levant, by being too far to be oftner remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>The Republick confers the titles of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditors, Counts, Governours, Captains or <hi>Caſtellans,</hi> upon ſuch Nobles as ſhe ſends into the Cities of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> for the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice; the Magiſtrates of the two principal places, the Counties of <hi>Zara</hi> and <hi>Spalatro,</hi> being two Archbiſhopbricks, are aſſiſted by a Council of three <hi>Noble Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> without whom they are not to come to any Reſolution; yet all theſe Officers obey the Proveditor of the Province, who hath an abſolute command in theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as likewiſe in thoſe of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary concern. The Troupes maintain'd by the Republick in this Province, which borders upon the territories of the Grand Seignior, are however commanded by a foreign General; who is in all occaſions to follow the orders of the Proveditor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iſles</hi> of <hi>Corfu, Zante</hi> and <hi>Cafalonia,</hi> are each of them Governed by a Proveditor, aſſiſted by a Council of three <hi>Noble Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Corfu</hi> is the moſt conſiderable not only for being an Archbiſhopbrick, but likewiſe becauſe it commands the entrance of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102922:134"/>
Gulph; therefore the <hi>Venetians</hi> provide for the Security of this place with ſo much more Application, as it is the Preſervation of their Levant Trade, and obſerved with the Greateſt Jealouſie by the <hi>Turks.</hi> The Four Thouſand <hi>Janiſaries</hi> that appear'd not long ſince upon the Coaſt over againſt <hi>Corfu,</hi> occaſioned to the Senate a mighty uneaſineſs Notwithſtanding the ſtrength and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Fortreſs of this Important place.</p>
                     <p>There is a General of the three <hi>Iſlands</hi> to whom the particular Proveditors owe the ſame obedience, which the Magiſtrates of the Cities of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> do to the Proveditor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of this Province. Theſe are the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to whom is confided the Authority of the Prince in the ſeveral States of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.

The Republick therefore hath thought ſit to make uſe of the Inquiſitors, to prevent and cure at the ſame time both theſe Diſtempers.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Republick</hi> commonly holds every five years in all the Provinces an Extrordinary Court or Seſſion; and for this purpoſe chooſes out three of the firſt Senators, to whom is given the Name of Inquiſitors of <hi>Terra firma,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe of the State<hi>:</hi> but as this Commiſſion is in no manner agreeable to them, by reaſon of the Severity they are oblig'd to ſhew againſt ſuch as are complained of, ſo they only accept of it as not daring to refuſe it; they are to examine into the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the <hi>Podeſtats,</hi> the behaviour of the Captains and other <hi>Publick</hi> Officers, as likewiſe to receive the People's complaints againſt their behavour, and to do them Juſtice in the wrongs received; but, excepting of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion and the ill application of the publick revenues, the Noble Venetians need not much fear the Puniſhments that are due to an irregular Adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſevere Magiſtrates go attended with a Troop of Horſe, Officers and an Executioner; that ſo they may (ſeeing they have ſufficient power and Authority) render a quick and rigorous Juſtice, upon the Lawful complaints of the People; yet Notwithſtanding the great noiſe of theſe examining Inquiſitors, the Tempeſt Lights commonly upon ſome
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102922:135"/>
Miſerable Wretch, or Gentleman of <hi>Terra firma;</hi> their Gentry having more cauſe of apprehenſion than any others whatever, as being the People that are moſt Liable to be made Examples. This Severity keeps the Magiſtrates to their Duty, the Country No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in fear and Submiſſion, and inſinuates to the People the Mildneſs and equity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment under which they live.</p>
                     <p>As the Provinces of <hi>Terra firma</hi> are in a manner under the eyes of the <hi>Republick;</hi> ſo the abuſes of Officers in adminiſtration of Juſtice are neither ſo great nor ſo frequent, but the inquiries are more eaſy and the Puniſhment leſs rarely avoided. On the other ſide the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, in the Goverments of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and the <hi>Iſles</hi> of the Levant, an exactneſs of theſe inquiries would be of an extraordinary good effect to their Subjects, for when they have ſent thither theſe Inquiſitors, they have not only met with many difficulties in proceeding accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their methods upon <hi>Terra firma,</hi> againſt Magiſtrates at ſuch a diſtance and Separated from them by the Sea: but the Inquiſitors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have not Judg'd it ſafe for their Perſons, if they ſhould attempt to execute their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the uſual rigour; inſomuch that there are none of the Senate to be prevail'd upon to execute theſe Employs beyond Sea.</p>

                     <p>THE Republick of Venice is rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd through the reputation ſhe hath acquired, than by the great Number of Troops that ſhe hath in her Service; inſomch that in time of Peace, ſhe hath ſcarce Forces ſufficient for the <hi>Garriſons</hi> ſhe is oblig'd to have for the Security of the State. The whole Number of regular Troops that are kept on foot, ſince the concluſion of the Peace after the taking of <hi>Candia,</hi> does not amount unto ſix thouſand Men, including both the <hi>Cavalry</hi> and <hi>Infantry,</hi> part whereof is diſtributed into the Fortified Places of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> under the command of the Proveditor General of this Province, and the foreign General before mentioned; the remainder is under the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Arms in the City's upon <hi>Terra firma,</hi> eſpecially in thoſe that border upon the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe</p>
                     <p>The Infantery of the <hi>Republick</hi> in time of peace is chiefly compoſed of Capelets, that is <note place="margin">Capaleti.</note> 
                        <hi>Slavonians, Morlaques;</hi> and <hi>Albanians,</hi> which People come from the other ſide of the Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Sea; they border upon the <hi>Turks;</hi> they are their irreconcilable Enemys, and never in Peace with them; and to ſuch a degree that it
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102922:136"/>
hath been obſerved in <hi>Candia,</hi> when any one of thoſe <hi>Infidels</hi> have happened to be blown into the Town upon the Springing of a mine, he hath no ſooner been upon the Ground, but theſe Slavonians have cut him in pieces to ſatisfie their revenge by eating him almoſt quick. Their Arms are long <hi>Sabres</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> they are good Souldiers and Affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately faithful to the <hi>Republick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cavalry is partly compoſed of the ſame Capelets, of <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltramontains,</hi> for ſo they call the <hi>French and Germans;</hi> as the pay and the Companies of theſe are larger, than thoſe of the Capelets, ſo they are uſually conferred as rewards upon thoſe Officers that have Signaliz'd themſelves in the ſervice of the <hi>Republick;</hi> beſides theſe there are about Forty or Fifty of them they call <hi>Condotti,</hi> or Penſioners; whereby they are ever aſſured of having ready a certain Number of experienc'd and faithful Officers, againſt any ſudden occaſion that may oblige them to raiſe new Troops; for which reaſon theſe Officers are well payed, enjoying thoſe Privileges, which intitle them to much conſideration in this State; moreover, when they have any buſineſs at the College, they are allowed to ſpeak Sitting.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Republick</hi> hath in their Service upon <hi>Terra firma,</hi> only Fifteen Troops of Horſe; however beſides them there are Eight or ten thouſand foot for ſhew, theſe do not coſt them much, neither are they very Serviceable to them. They are the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Terra Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> commonly called <hi>Cernide,</hi> that is Men
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102922:137"/>
Selected to carry Arms; whoſe chief buſineſs is to be frequently excercis'd and paſs the review; that ſo Foreigners and neighbouring Princes may believe that the <hi>Republick</hi> is ever ſtongly provided; The Captains and Serjeants are only payed, as for the Souldiers they are contented with ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions; however upon any ſudden occaſion this <hi>Militia</hi> might be made very Serviceable to the <hi>Republick,</hi> by joyning them to the Body of their other ſtanding forces.</p>
                     <p>Although the <hi>Republick</hi> is of the Opinion that a War is much more chargeable to them than to all other Princes, by reaſon they Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy only foreign Troops, yet they rather chooſe to be at that charge, as likewiſe the uncertainty of being Well Serv'd by them, which is but Seldom; than to train up their own Subjects to diſcipline, and render them capable of being feared for the future. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they are engag'd in a Land War, the <hi>Republick</hi> does not only raiſe their Troops out of their Dominions, but they likewiſe give the command of them to ſome Prince, or Perſon of conſideration whom ſhe engages to her Intereſt by the large Allowances that are given him. This General hath under him Generals of the Cavalry and infantry; but the two Nobles which the Senate gives him for Aſſiſtants, with the Titles of Proveditors General, do in effect only leave him the Name of <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> for they are to confirm all Reſolutions and order the deſigns of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102922:137"/>
Campaign; they rarely permit of any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that proceed not from themſelves, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obliging the experience of the Principal Officers, to give way to the Jealouſie they have of their own Authority.</p>
                     <p>The Senate gives their Principal Application to the Marine Affairs; the Genius of theſe People is very Inclinable to all Naval at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; they ſupport the weight of theſe Wars with much leſs difficulty, than thoſe upon Land; this Republick hath raiſed it ſelf from the Sea, and to her ſhe is indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her great increaſe; It is through her Maritime forces that ſhe is become for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and which formerly gained her thoſe very large Conqueſts. As the <hi>Venetians</hi> are born in the Sea, ſo they are not leſs Skilful upon this Element than they are happy; inſomuch that for one Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage received, they may reckon a Hundred Times Succeſs; their valour ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them Maſters of the <hi>Adriatick Gulf,</hi> and there is no queſtion but they will as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly aſſert that poſſeſſion, as they Judge the conſequences of it to be very Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
                     <p>In times of Peace the Republick does not maintain a certain Regulated Naval force, however they are always able to ſet out in a very little time five and twenty Gallies; She keeps in the Gulf only a Squadron of Six Gallies, ſeveral <hi>Galiots</hi> and <hi>Brigantins;</hi>
                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:102922:138"/>
which are continually cruiſing at the entrance of this Sea, for the ſecurity of their Trade againſt the Corſaires, but eſpecially to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Duties upon all Merchants. Yet this does not prevent the <hi>Pyrates</hi> of <hi>Dulcigno,</hi> who are Subjects to the <hi>Turk,</hi> from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times making their Incurſions into <hi>Romagnia,</hi> and the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Ancona</hi> near <hi>Loretto</hi> this is very uneaſy to the Pope who hath caus'd his <hi>Nuncio</hi> to make great complaints to the <hi>Senate;</hi> for he permits the <hi>Republick</hi> to receive the Tenths of the Clergy, upon condition that they ſhall defend the Coaſts of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical State</hi> from the Inſults of theſe Infidels.</p>
                     <p>This Squadron is commanded by a Noble of the firſt order, to whom is given the Title of General of the Gulf; this Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion is for Three Years; the <hi>Galliaſſes</hi> and Men of War have likewiſe their diſtinct Generals in time of War; at preſent the <hi>Republick</hi> hath only two <hi>Galliaſſes</hi> at Sea, whoſe Station is at <hi>Corfu,</hi> there are likewiſe ſome Men of War for the Convoys of Merchants, who attribute their frequent loſſes in the Levant, to the want of the Neceſſary Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men of War, which the <hi>Republick</hi> ought to have at Sea for the Security of their Commerce.</p>
                     <p>Whether the <hi>Republick</hi> hath a Naval Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for the execution of ſome deſign; or that ſhe hath only the uſual forces which ſhe maintains in times of Peace, and the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102922:138"/>
Squadron of the Gulf; Yet ſhe always Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates a Proveditor General of the Sea, who hath the command of the Fleet. This Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy is executed by one of firſt <hi>Senators,</hi> he hath an abſolute Power over the Officers, Souldiers and Seamen, being enabled to put to Death any of them, as likewiſe to diſpoſe of all the Offices of the Fleet. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor General of the Sea commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides at <hi>Corfu,</hi> his Employ continues two Years, at the end of which he gives the Senate an account of the adminiſtration of his Office.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Republick</hi> enters into a War by Sea, ſhe does not give the command of her forces to a foreign General, as is practis'd in thoſe a-ſhoar: but in theſe important junctures, upon which ſeems to depend the intire ſafety of the State, the <hi>Republick</hi> conſtitutes ſome Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> General by Sea, who does not only command the other before mentioned General Officers; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all Governours of Maritime Places, to whom he ſends his orders according to the various circumſtances of the time and War; he moreover diſpoſes and orders without controul all Offices, and Revenues appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſupport of the Army. Yet the apprehenſions of an Inquiry, and the indiſpenſable neceſity of giving the Senate an exact report of what he had done; makes the General very aſſiduous in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out plauſible pretences to all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102922:139"/>
for which he is accountable at the expiration of this almoſt Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; which always ceaſes before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to Venice to appear befor the College,</p>
                     <p>This moſt eminent Dignity in the State, is only while the War continues. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator <hi>Francis Moroſini</hi> was the laſt that executed it, who defended the City of <hi>Candia</hi> in the late Wars; it is thought the <hi>Republick</hi> had not a more proper Perſon for the execution of this conſiderable poſt, and the examination which was made into his conduct for the Surrendring of that Place, and the inquiries into his Adminiſtration of the Revenues, which made him twice a Priſoner and both times in danger, is an evident proof how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it is to Serve a <hi>Republick;</hi> where a General is in a manner oblig'd to ſatisfie the the ſmalleſt Scruples of his greateſt Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Republick</hi> creates a <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> by Sea, She ſends into the Fleet a foreign General, who hath the command of all the Forces that are to be Employed in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents on ſhoar; yet he is not to undertake any thing upon his own bottom, but this General receives his orders from the <hi>Generaliſſimo;</hi> The <hi>Marqueſs de</hi> St. <hi>Andrè</hi> commanded in that quality at <hi>Candia,</hi> whoſe acceptable
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102922:139"/>

                     <p>IT would be very Tedious to give a long account of the Revenues of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, and to make a particular Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what each City and Province amounts to.

I ſhall at the ſame time endeavour to ſhew what ways and means the Republick hath taken, to oppoſe all the attempts of the <hi>Turks</hi> both by Sea and Land; as likewiſe to maintain a War for five and twenty years together againſt ſo Powerful an Empire.</p>
                     <p>It is a difficult matter to know the exact value of theſe Revenues, being the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is always Augmenting and Diminiſhing of them, according to the Neceſſities of the

War and occaſions in Peace. However according to Computation of the Rigiſter of Receipts, before the preſſing Neceſſities of the laſt War of <hi>Candia,</hi> it appeared that the eſtabliſhed Revenue did amount to no more than Fourteen Millions of Livers <hi>French</hi> Money.</p>
                     <p>One half of this Revenue proceeded from the Duties at <hi>Venice</hi> upon the Importation and Exportation of goods, in the exciſe upon Proviſions, and all other Merchandiſes ſold at the tenth penny Duty, and duties ariſing from the <hi>Iſlands</hi> of the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> as likewiſe upon all goods in the Limits of the Country near <hi>Venice,</hi> which is called the <hi>Dutchy</hi> or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other part of this Revenue riſes from the Cities and Provinces of <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> in impoſitions upon Goods, Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cuſtom of Merchandiſe, in Tithes and the Tenth Penny, as likewiſe from what is raiſed in <hi>Iſtria, Dalmatia</hi> and the three <hi>Iſlands</hi> of <hi>Corfu, Zant</hi> and <hi>Chefal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
                     </p>

The Salt Works at <hi>Corfu</hi> produc'd two Millions; that at <hi>Chioſa,</hi> one; by which it appears that the Republick received above Eighteen Millions.</p>

In War the Republick Augments the old impoſitions and eſtabliſhes new ones, Taxes the eaſy, and the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> from whom by the Pope's conſent ſhe draws very conſiderable Summs, in all her Wars againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> They likewiſe obtained the Abolition of ſeveral Orders as thoſe of the Holy Ghoſt and the Croiſade, the Sale of whoſe effects amounted to very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Summs,</p>

from which the Republick have found the means of making that Reſiſtance, which hath been the Admiration of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The eſtabliſhed expences of the Republick do not annually exceed Ten Millions of Livers, which are partly employed to defray the charges of the Doge, of Ambaſſadors, the Salaries of Officers, the pay of both Horſe and Foot upon <hi>Terra Firma</hi> and in the Levant, as likewiſe to defray the charges of the Navy, Arcenal and Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the State. As to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences which the Republick is oblig'd to, in cleaning the Canals of <hi>Venice,</hi> and for the maintenance of ſuch as Lie Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uſeful to the City, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Summs ariſing from ſeveral Impoſitions that are to this purpoſe given, and particularly applied to theſe matters; Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Summs which the Republick pays for intereſt of money upon the <hi>Zecque,</hi> or Treaſury Chamber, are comprehended within the Calculation of Ten Millions; but ſince the Peace of <hi>Candia</hi> the Republick hath diſcharg'd her ſelf of the great Intereſt ſhe payed for Sums lent upon the Bank of <hi>Venice,</hi> by Incorporating them into the Conſtitution at three per cent; but as they only payed the half of that Intereſt, by
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102922:141"/>
Reaſon of the great Neceſſities of the State during the late War, ſo they have turn'd the Arrears into Principal, for which is allowed two <hi>per cent.</hi> The Republick hath moreover reduc'd to five all other Summs that were formerly at ſix, ſeven and eight <hi>per cent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There being a great deal due to the Officers that had ſerved the Republick in the late Wars, they thought fit to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a declaration importing that no Officers ſhould be payed, but thoſe whoſe accounts were admitted, and even they were only to receive the half of what appeared in their accounts; the Republick did not only thus avoid taking notice of the damage ſhe did to particulars by theſe ſorts of Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſo much Augmented her Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by conſiderably diminiſhing her charge, but they likewiſe order no payment that is not ballotted in the College and Senate; ſo they are ſure to be oppreſs'd with charges that proſecute their debts, for her cuſtom is to pay no more than a very moderate part at a time.</p>
                     <p>By theſe means the Republick in times of Peace does every year bring ſeveral Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, into the Coffers of the Treaſury. Which is the more eaſy by reaſon their Treaſury is not only manag'd with an exact fidelity, but likewiſe becauſe there can be no new Employ made without having a

                     <p>IF it be true, That Education does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute leſs to the Improvement of Youth, than the Natural Diſpoſition to Good; one ought not to wonder at the young Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> who not being reſtrain'd by thoſe Conſiderations that uſually engage Young People to the Principles of Vertue, or at leaſt that preſerves them from Vice; ſhould Live ſo Irregularly and ſhew ſo little Moderation in their Conduct. I pretend to ſpeak now only of the Young Nobility; as not deſigning to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my ſelf here to a General Deſcription of the Cuſtoms and Inclinations of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which will be ſufficiently ſhewn in the courſe of this Account.</p>

The Fathers and Mothers here are ſo infinitely Fond of their Children, that they never lay any reſtraint upon them; for whom they have ſo great a Complacency as never to deny them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing they deſire. They are no ſooner able to go, but they begin to Cloath them with the Richeſt things, and at Five or Six Years Old they put them into the black Habit, and Cloak ruffled with Gold or Silver-Laces, their fondneſs even reaches the Shoes, for they are then rais'd with very high Heels, which are to make them look Taller than they really are; and doubtleſs this may be one reaſon of their Walking ſo very ill as they do ever afterwards.</p>
                     <p>It is not anly this blind Affection of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that firſt begins to corrupt the Manners of their Young People, by rendring them Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Imperious, Laſcivious, and violent in all their Paſſions, but the ſordid Flattery of their Domeſtick Servants does ſtrangely help to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Ill: For thoſe Creatures think to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh their Fortunes by getting theſe Young Gentlemen to be their faſt Protectors, for which purpoſe they uſe their utmoſt endeavours as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well aſſured that there is nothing that they may not hope for at <hi>Venice,</hi> when they are under the protection of one of their Powerful Houſes upon which Conſiderations theſe Children are Ador'd and Regarded as the certain hope of their riſing Fortune.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Gentlemen being thus early accuſtom'd to be Treated like Princes, and finding no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Career of their Deſires, do inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly poſſeſs themſelves with the thoughts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Superior to all other Perſons of Quality;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102922:145"/>
but when they begin to perceive that they are the only Mighty in the State, they then elevate the Notion to that degree as to become Inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to all others. For which Reaſon it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare for Strangers to find much Civility from thoſe People, unleſs it be among thoſe that have learn'd the Rules of good Breeding in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries; of which number ſuch as have ſeen <hi>France</hi> do much diſtinguiſh themſelves from the reſt.</p>
                     <p>One may vainly imaginy that if this Young Nobility is not engag'd to the Study of good Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by the Natural Inclination join'd to a great diſpoſition of Learning; there cannot be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny expected to penetrate very far into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Sciences; inſomuch that whatever Care is taken about the Inſtruction of theſe Gentlemen either in the School or their Houſes, yet they are not to be prevail'd upon to exceed what they themſelves think fit. In the mean time the Parents do not much trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the matter, for they are contented with the hopes of ſeeing them <hi>Venetian</hi> Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at laſt: However in this numerous Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there are ſome Gentlemen that Naturally take to Study, which they follow with great Succeſs.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as theſe Young Gentlemen are Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or Seventeen Years Old, they begin to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate with thoſe of a more advanc'd Age, and to purſue their Pleaſures with the ampleſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: As they do not want Precedenrs in the Company they keep, nor for Opportunities in this Famous City of <hi>Venice;</hi> ſo it may eaſily be imagined without any farther Inſtances, what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102922:146"/>
ſort of a Life they lead. Such as have Money commonly ſpend it in Pleaſure, for they are not contented with one Courtiſan, but employ it to the Support of ſeveral: Their Parents are ſo far from oppoſing the Libertiniſm, that on the contrary, they uſually contribute to the Exceſs; or at beſt, but ſhut their Eyes to the Extravagancy of their Conduct.</p>
                     <p>The Son of a Procurator by Merit, that had a great ſhare in the Dogal Dignity, after the Death of the Doge <hi>Contarini,</hi> was ſo mightily in Love with the moſt Beautiful and Honeſteſt Courtiſan of <hi>Venice</hi> (if there are any ſo) that he never ſtirr'd from her. The Father being afflicted that he could not enjoy the Preſence of his Son ſo much as he deſir'd, advis'd him to bring the Miſtreſs home; telling him, in ſoft <hi>Venetian,</hi> That he ſhould not increaſe the Charge of his Table by their being with him, and that at leaſt he ſhould have the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeeing him oftner.</p>
                     <p>Such of theſe Gentlemen as have not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to ſupport the Charge of their Deſires, wreck their Inventions to acquire the Means of ſupplying their Neceſſities. They beſtow their Protections upon Perſons that are able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Favour, and if they are thoſe forward Gentlemen that are always ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Value of their Merits, or of them that are become formidable for their Violencies and Bully-Deeds, they make a greater noiſe by their Names, and occaſion more Terrour to all that are concerned with them, than the principal Senators are able to effect with their ampleſt Authorities.</p>

If an Unfortunate Wretch has a declared Enemy, whoſe ſevere Uſage he has reaſon to fear, he needs but to apply himſelf to one of thoſe Noblemen, who immediately ſends to admoniſh him not to undertake any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perſon he has received into Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; farther aſſuring him, That if the leaſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happens to the Perſon he protects, he may be certain of ſeeing himſelf deprived both of his Legs and his Arms. Or when any one knows not how to get in a bad Debt, his beſt Remedy is to one of theſe Noblemen, who preſently ſends to the Perſon owing the Money, aſſigns him a Term of time to pay it, which he dares no more refuſe, than if he were condemn'd to it in a Court of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>This Proceeding of theſe Gentlemen is call'd at <hi>Venice, Tenir Tribunale,</hi> altho' it is odious to the Republick, and contrary to the Laws and Liberties of the Subject; nevertheleſs all Eyes are generally clos'd to theſe Diſorders. This Arrogance of the greateſt. Part of the Young <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, and the Violencies which they frequently execute upon private Perſons, do inſenſibly acquire them that Hatred which may at ſome time chance to be fatal to them.</p>
                     <p>The moſt Part of theſe Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> have a certain ſort of Men in their Service that are qualified for any Villany, they are known in <hi>France</hi> by the Name of <hi>Ham-ſtringers,</hi> but are at <hi>Venice</hi> honour'd with the Title of <hi>Bravo</hi>'s: Their Buſineſs is to diſpatch a Man with Powder and Ball, or for the greater Privacy, to make uſe of their Ponyards; as alſo to cut and ſlaſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102922:147"/>
the Face of a Woman that has given any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Complaint, which is termed at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, dar un Sfriſo;</hi> that is, to Scarify the Cheeks of ſuch an Unfortunate Perſon: When any of theſe Braves have an Affair to adjuſt with one that wears a Sword, whom he deſigns to attack like a Man of Honour, <hi>da huomo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norato,</hi> as they call it, without any manner of Treachery; they equip themſelves with a good Coat of Mail under a Buff-coat, an Iron-Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, a well temper'd Helmet faſtned to his Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and a Sword about two Foot long, but at leaſt three Fingers broad, and cuts on both ſides; at leaſt when the Man is thus fitted out, he covers all his Equipage with a Champaign-Cloak that he throws over him.</p>
                     <p>When the Bravo meets with his Man, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately throws away both Hat and Cloak, he covers his Head with the Iron-Cap, draws his Sword, and in an inſtant puts himſelf into the proper poſture behind his Buckler. I met once one of theſe Gentlemen in this Figure, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was to have attack'd a Stranger, who ſav'd himſelf at a Courteſans, and appearing at the Window, the Bravo becken'd to him to come down; ſaying, <hi>Meſſer foreſto vegni abaſſo, veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni abaſſo;</hi> but the Stranger did not think fit to expoſe himſelf to an Enemy ſo advantageouſly Armed.</p>
                     <p>Play in general, but eſpecially that of <hi>Baſſet,</hi> is the mighty Paſſion of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> yet this Game is rather us'd by thoſe advanc'd to ſome Years, than by the more Youthful Nobility, who much rather chuſe to purſue the Dictates of their Inclinations to Pleaſure, than to engage
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102922:147"/>
themſelves to a Game that is not ordinarily us'd for ſmall Sums. Not long ſince, one of the firſt Senators of the Republick, ſupported with much Affliction, the frequent Loſſes which his Son receiv'd at Play: However he was afraid to diſcover plainly to him the Grief it gave him, and only ventur'd to ſay one Night, upon his loſing of two Hundred <hi>Hungars, Tu te ſei portato bene oggi;</hi> You have play'd your Part very well to Day: To which the Son reply'd very briskly, <hi>Non voglio queſti muſi,</hi> I do not deſire to be ſo received; and the very next Day he left <hi>Venice,</hi> acquainted his Father by one of his Friends, that he was not to expect to ſee him any more; and that he was then going to <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the Grief of the Affiicted Father for the loſs of his Son; who in a diſtracted condition enquir'd of every one he ſaw. <hi>Is it poſſible for me to live without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of my Son!</hi> Revien caro mio figliolo Pietro. <hi>Return my dear Child, and you ſhall not only have the Two hundred Hungers but likewiſe the Keys of my Caſh,</hi> and forthwith diſpatch'd away ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expreſſes with Money to bring back the Son whom he never expected to ſee more.</p>
                     <p>It may be imagined from hence, if the Young Nobility who are Educated with ſo much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, equally adored by their Parents and Servants, free of all reſtraint, accuſtom'd to purſue with the ampleſt liberty all the Motives of their Deſires, moreover poſſeſs'd with an imaginary Opinion of themſelves, and of the Power they have to make themſelves obeyed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through Fear or Authority: If theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102922:148"/>
I ſay, who are thus educated, ought not to be very different in all things from thoſe that are educated in other Countries; but more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in <hi>France,</hi> where the ſtudy of good Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Exerciſes of the Body and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Perſons of Wit and Virtue, do uſually employ the more tender Years of Perſons of Quality.</p>
                     <p>As the Young Nobility are in ſome meaſure aſſured to eſcape unpuniſhed, ſo they are ſcarce to be retain'd from their extravagances by any manner of conſideration, of which take the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Example. About four or five years ſince five Young Gentlemen not knowing how to paſs away the Evening, agreed among themſelves to do ſomething that might make a noiſe and themſelves talked of. One propos'd to ſet on fire <hi>Il Ghetto,</hi> that part of the City Inhabited by the <hi>Jews;</hi> another was of Opinion to force into the Houfe of one the handſomeſt Ladies at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and there to execute what their pleaſure prompted them to; but the propoſition of the third Man was agreed upon as moſt agreeable to theſe Gentlemen. He ſaid that a Nunnery of the Order of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> in a certain Iſland two Miles diſtant from <hi>Venice</hi> was at that time Repairing, and that he thought they could not paſs the tsme better than to take that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of entring the Breach.</p>
                     <p>All of them immediately Dreſs'd themſelves in White, took Boats and atriv'd at the Place about Midnight, which they entred unto the very Dormitories. The firſt of the Religious that came running out upon the noiſe by her ſhricks alarm'd the whole Covent, upon which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102922:148"/>
the Bell was Rung, and ſeveral of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants came to give their Aſſiſtance: But the Nobles not thinking themſelves ſafe fled to theit Gondolo's, and return'd to <hi>Venice.</hi> This Action was mightily nois'd about in the Morning, various were the Opinons upon this Diſorder at the Nunnery, and ſeveral different Relations made of it; but at the end of Three Days the Authors were diſcover'd and Baniſh'd the City upon very rigorous Penalties: Yet in leſs than Six Months they appear'd there again without any farther Notice being taken of them.</p>
                     <p>It is nevertheleſs certain that there are a great many Civil Gentlemen among the Young Nobility of <hi>Venice;</hi> yet they are generally theſe as have ſpent ſome time in other Countries; who having ſeen another Nobility in <hi>Europe,</hi> which not being leſs regarded for their Perſonal Merits than for their Births, do obſerve a quite different Conduct, and by their Civilities they ſhew to Strangers, which is even ſometimes to exceſs, do mightily diſtinguiſh themſelves from thoſe Nobles that were never out of their State.</p>

                     <head>Of the Habit of the Nobles.</head>
                     <p>IT is obſerv'd that the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility have ever imitated the long Garnment of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and the ancient Cuſtom of <hi>Rome.</hi> For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages paſt rhey did wear along Blew Robe; but at length it was unalterably fix'd to a long back Veſt that comes down to the Ground: The Sleeves are half an Ell wide and come down to the Wriſt: They are made very narrow at the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102922:149"/>
end, leaving only ſpace enough to put through the Hand, but the Sleeve is round at the bottom of the end like a Night-Gown, in which the Nobility carry what others uſually wear in the Pockets of their Coats. The Collar of the Veſt is rais'd directly up round about the Neck, and open before; as likewiſe the Doublet which is very high and of the ſame ſhape. A ſtarch'd little round Band is ſow'd to the inſide Shirt negligently falls a Finger's breadth over the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the Waſtcoat, and the Neck of the which is uſually faſtned with a Gold or Diamond-Buckle. In Summer they wear the Veſt open and flying back, the forepart being lined with Black Taffaty. But the indiſpenſable Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of having it in all Seaſons of <hi>Padua-</hi>Cloth, is during the great Heat, a moſt inſupportable Puniſhment to the greateſt part of the Nobility.</p>
                     <p>The Gentlemen are all mighty fond of the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion, for they wear under their Veſts very pretty Waſtcoats of Black Silk; but they always run into Exceſs, ſometimes by ſhort lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Waſtcoats Scallop'd at the bottom, or elſe with others very large, and odly ruffled with Laces. Altho' they are forbid the Uſe of <hi>Points of Venice,</hi> yet the Necks and Wriſts of their Shirts are frequently Laced with them, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Back of the Sleeve; and that this may be more ſeen, they uſually turn up the Sleeve of the Veſt, which ought to be worn over their Hands; for the Taylors that make theſe Veſts, are obliged under great Forfeitures, to cut the Sleeves long, and the Veſt ſhort, that is, ſo as it may not hang upon the Ground, which is the direct contrary to what they deſire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102922:149"/>
All thoſe that wear the Veſt as Senators, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Citizens, have only on their Heads a knit Cap of Worſted, which is edg'd about with a ſort of long wrought Fleece-Wool, that ſomething reſembles a Hat-band. The greateſt part of the Young Nobility, wear this Cap more in their Hands than upon their Heads; by which uſe, and the care they have of their Hair, one ſees here ſuch beautiful Heads, that are no where elſe to be found. However this did not prevent them from making uſe of Sciſars, when they were ſo earneſtly bent upon Perukes; the Uſe of which is yet forbidden: However they begin to fall into them again, and the more by reaſon the Inquiſitors of State are eaſily prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to permit the Wear of the ſhort Wig and Cap. I doubt not but that they will be permitted again, for theſe they wear at preſent, do perceptibly become longer every Day more than other; inſomuch that a little more time will, without diſpute, render that Faſhion ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                     <p>They are oblig'd to wear a Stole of an Ell long over their Veſts; this is a certain breadth of the ſame Cloath with the Veſt, doubled and ſowed together, with two very large Liſts at the Ends: This is caſt over the left Shoulder, to one of which ends was formerly faſtned the Cap, as are at preſent the <hi>Aumuce</hi> of the Regular Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; ſo the other end of this Stole, or Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Sleeve, came almoſt down to their Heels: At preſent this is eſteem'd for a Mark of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, a Noble dares not appear at the <hi>Broglio</hi> without this on the Shoulder: However the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens that wear the Veſt, have the ſame Badge,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102922:150"/>
with which they all cover their Head, when they chance to be ſurprized in the Streets by a Shower of Rain.</p>
                     <p>Only the Counſellors of the Doge, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> the Preſidents of the Council of <hi>Ten,</hi> the great Sages, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Terra firma,</hi> are excuſed from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of this heavy Garment in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who by a particular Privilege wear, as it has been obſerved, a Veſt of fine Camblet. But as the Nobility may be pitied in this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo they are no leſs to be envied in Winter<hi>:</hi> For in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> they begin to line their Veſts with Furs, the more Ancient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely through the Body; but others the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Sides only, with a Border of fine Blewiſh Fur, about four Fingers broad, that comes down on each Side from the top to the bottom of the Veſt, the ſame is edg'd round the Hand of the Sleeve: This Border, or Edging, comes about a Finger's breadth below the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſt on the inſide. The Veſt is croſs'd over their Stomachs from the Left to the Right, which they faſten by a Girdle of Velvet about three Fingers broad, which they wear about their Waſtes; this Girdle is ſtitch'd on the Sides with an Edging of Silk, it is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with a dozen Silver-Boſſes that cover the whole fore part of the Girdle. This is made exactly to the bigneſs of the Waſte, for at the Ends there are two large Silver-Haſps, which claſp together over the Belly.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can look greater than this ſort of Habit, under which the Nobility ſeem to be well made; they commonly turn back the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102922:150"/>
of the Veſt with the Left-hand, carrying he Right upon the Stomack in the opening of the Veſt, whereby is commonly ſeen the Handle of their Dagger. One that would not look ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well in our Champaign-Dreſs, makes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Figure in the Veſt: For few of them have their Legs well made, or Straight; beſides they generally turn their Feet inwards: This fault is common to both Sexes at <hi>Venice,</hi> for the Policy of the Country does not permit to the Ladies the Advantage of Dancing-Maſters; and the Negligence of the Young Nobility is ſuch, that they will not long conſtrain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to go otherwiſe, altho' they have had the good Fortune to meet with ſome Foreign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that have given them the neceſſary Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>The Young Nobility are not oblig'd to wear this Habit unleſs they have attain'd to the Years of entring into the Great Council, which is at Twenty five, provided they are not of the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which by particular Privilege are by Lot drawn every Year, from among thoſe above Twenty two, that give in their Names for their chance to this Preferment. Nevertheleſs their Parents; if they can perſwade them to it, put them into the Veſt at Fifteen or Sixteen, for this Garment which is by the Republick call'd the Habit of their Religion, does in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure oblige ſuch as wear it, to obſerve ſome Rules of Decency, and engage them to live with more Moderation than thoſe that are not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with it.</p>
                     <p>Yet the Nobility are not the only Perſons that wear at <hi>Venice</hi> this ſort of Apparel. The
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102922:151"/>
Phyſitians, Lawyers, Secretaries of the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, Notaries, ſeveral other Officers of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; and a great many Citizens have the ſame Apparel without any manner of diſtinction; inſomuch that without a great familiarity with them, it is altogether impoſſible to make any diſtinction between them. It has been often times propoſed to have ſome external Mark, whereby the Nobility might be diſtinguiſh'd from ſuch as are not of that Body, but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate could never be induced to admit of the propoſition.</p>
                     <p>Some ſay that the intention of the Republick is thereby to ſhew the number of their Nobility larger than it really is, and by that means ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it more conſiderable in the thoughts of their Subjects and thoſe Strangers that come to <hi>Venice:</hi> Others imagine that the Nobility think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafer by this mixture; for if there ſhould happen again any Conſpiracies againſt the whole Body of the Nobility, they would have leſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſaving themſelves; as being now in a manner undiſcernably mix'd with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of them which ſuch Conſpirators would not deſtroy. I am of the opinion that this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit being in common between the Citizens and Nobility, does not a little help to acquire theſe the friendſhip of the Former, who are part of the Principal Members in the Body of this State, and who are much better beloved by the People than the Nobility, as being infinitely more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging and Moderate.</p>
                     <p>Yet certain it is that the Republick has very good Reaſons in adhering to theſe Reſolutions, for ſhe is abſolutely againſt all Innovations of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102922:151"/>
this Nature, notwithſtanding the Shame which the Dignity of this Veſt receives, by a great many dirty Wretches going in it to Market to buy a Penny-worth of Anchovies. I do not mean any of thoſe Gentlemen that do it for their Pleaſure, by ſending home what they like, which is the common Cuſtome of <hi>Italy,</hi> and many Provinces of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the Habit of a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> attracts a Reſpect to them that wear it, ſo it reduces them to ſuch a Servitude to the Nobility, that except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who are by their Employs oblig'd to wear the Veſt, few of the Citizens are found willing to put it on; for in the moſt of thoſe Families that have ſeveral Children, they give it him that is leaſt capacitated for any other Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and which is only to preſerve to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily the Honour of having the Veſt. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, Strangers, and all other Perſons are no ways obliged to ſhew any particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect upon meeting any of the Nobility in the Streets, and by the Liberty of the Country their Gentlemen do not expect to be ſaluted by them, but if any of thoſe wearing the Veſt, who are not Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſhould paſs by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making their profoundeſt Reſpects to their Excellencies, of which <hi>Venice</hi> abounds, they would poſſibly expoſe themſelves to ſomething more ſevere than a ſimple Reprimand.</p>
                     <p>The Young Nobility cannot behold a Citizen in a Veſt, without Contempt and ſome ſort of Envy, who are by this means as well clad as themſelves; beſides, they are ſenſibly touched to ſee their Inferiours ſo perfectly reſembling to them; and their Capriciouſneſs hath ſo far
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102922:152"/>
tranſported them, which they term, <hi>Bel humore,</hi> that the Gentlemen of this Illuſtrious Body have often times forc'd into the Canals thoſe Young Citizens who have according to their Sentiments ſo much copied upon the Original, and played the Gallants.</p>

                        <hi>Of the</hi> Venetian <hi>Ladies.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>ALL Ladies, whither Citizens, or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that are of a Condition, above the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> aſſume at <hi>Venice</hi> the Quality of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledonna;</hi> yet only the Wives and Daughters of the Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> can properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gentledonna</hi>'s, and <hi>Patricie Venete.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are for the moſt part large of Stature, Majeſtick, High and Diſdainful in appearance; for I am perſwaded that in private they want neither Sweetneſs nor Complaiſance; they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeem to be of this Humour, as not having that Air of Quality which the Ladies of other Countries have, by living more ſociably, and leſs retired from the Commerce of the World.</p>
                     <p>Their way of living is ſo particular and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it is not altogether exempt of Brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they never, or very rarely viſit each other, and if they happen to meet any where, they do not converſe together, unleſs they are very particular Friends; and even this only hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens among them that have eſtabliſhed a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Society, In the main they are continually at home and Undreſs'd, excepting on Holidays, and ſome other Publick Solemnities of the Church, at which theſe Ladies do uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102922:152"/>
at leaſt they whoſe Husbands (are leſs Jealous, and more Affable than a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) have ſo much Complaiſance as to permit them to go to Church, which is one of the greateſt Diverſions they enjoy, and they ſtay there as long as they can, before they return: Yet there are thoſe who allow their Wives no farther Liberty than to perform their Devotions in the neareſt Church to them. Some carry this exceſs of Jealouſie to a higher degree, who without any ſcruple make their own Houſes their Wives Priſons, from whence they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permitted to ſtir.</p>
                     <p>Of ſix or ſeven Hundred Ladies of <hi>Venice,</hi> there are not above fifty or ſixty that appear at Church at a time, or any where Publickly. But upon any general Rejoycing (or at the Marriage of a Perſon of the firſt Quality, upon which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the Ladies are uſually invited, as they were to a ſplendid Ball at an Academy about two Years ſince) upon this occaſion there appear'd a mighty Number, among which few could be ſaid to be either beautiful, or agreeable, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the laſt of theſe Charms was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanting. There are ſeveral of thoſe that are allowed by their Husbands to appear abroad, who are Agreeable, Gentile, and very Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: However they are ſtrangely Accoutred through the great deſire they have to follow the <hi>French</hi> Faſhions; for they always run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Rules of the Mode, by the ill Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their lamentable Taylors.</p>
                     <p>In former Years they Dreſs'd themſelves with great Bunches of Ribbans on each Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102922:153"/>
and when the Men left off thoſe Knots of Ribans, for large Tufts of Silver and Gold, the Ladies did the ſame, wearing great Knots of that Work upon their Shoulders, and Toſſels at their Girdles tagg'd with great Points. As the Old and Deform'd love to ſpruce themſelves no leſs than the Young; ſo they Curl, Powder, and cover themſelves to that degree with Ribans ſo ill ſuited to their Age and Complexions, that in reality one cannot ſee a more extraordinary Figure, than one of theſe antiquated Ladies u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually make.</p>
                     <p>In coming from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> one finds ſo great a difference between the Air of theſe Ladies, and thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> as one would not believe that the Eyes ſhould ever be able to Fancy them. But having ſeen the other Parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> one ſoon acknowledges that the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ladies appear very well, and if the Severity that is obſerved upon their account, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them, they would always appear in that Magnificence they are ſometimes ſeen when they are permitted to ſhew themſelves in their Pearls and Jewels.</p>
                     <p>Next to their fine Points, and magnificent Gowns of Gold or Silver Tiſſue, they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that does adorn them more, or better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them, than the Flowers they wear, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe on their Heads; they have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Fancy in diſpoſing of them in their large Commodes: As theſe Flowers have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable good effect in their Dreſſes, ſo they have of them for all the ſeveral Seaſons of the Year. It is the moſt agreeable Preſent that a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102922:153"/>
Lover can make to his Miſtreſs, and he in return takes it for a moſt peculiar Favour to have that Flower beſtowed upon him, that hath had the preference of the reſt, by having been worn in the middle of her Boſom, which they ever have very much expoſed to view.</p>
                     <p>When a Lady goes into the Church, ſhe moves very ſlowly; her Gown is very long and large, training upon the Ground. The uſe of Pages or Footmen, being utterly unknown at <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhe is forc'd to chooſe her own Place, which ſhe does with the greateſt Air of Haughtineſs, diſpoſſeſſing both Citizen and Gentleman, without ſhewing any Demonſtration of Civility for the Place ſhe takes from either: As their Parents, when they are Children, nor their Husbands after they are Married do much regard, if they can make the Reverence cuſtomary with other Ladies; ſo there are very few that know how to acquit themſelves of it, when they are indiſpenſably obliged to receive the Salute, or to return the Civility to any Perſon of great Conſideration; they are then out of Countenance; for they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Civility by three ſeveral Motions, bending the Knees, lifting up the Belly, and nodding the Head to each Geſture, all which is done with Eyes and an Air that ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Confuſion they are under.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Ladies are attended to the Church, by as many Waiting-Women as they have, who do not ſtir one ſtep from their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, for they uſually ſtand in the greateſt Crowds both before and behind their Ladies, not a little proud to wait upon Perſons of that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102922:154"/>
Quality: Nothing can be more inconvenient than theſe Troops of Waiting-Women, in ſuch great Crowds; yet the Nobility are no ways backward in Civility to them, by reaſon of the good Offices they are able to do them, but more eſpecially to thoſe that wait upon the more beautiful Ladies.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Waiting-Women, part of whom being hired only for Days of Ceremony, are all clad in Gowns of black Serge, and great Taffeta Scarfs; they are uſually ſo familiar with their Ladies, that Strangers do wonder, not without reaſon, to ſee them upon their Knees leaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Ladies, but ſuch ought to know that theſe Women are all the Company they have at home, with whom they paſs their time in working of <hi>Point de Veniſe,</hi> and conſequently are fallen into the Cuſtom of Laughing and Talking familiarly with them.</p>
                     <p>The Unmarried Ladies, never ſee the Light in Publick, but through a great Veil of fine white Gauſe, which comes down before to the bottom of their Gowns, the two corners are tied with Knots of Ribbans that hang juſt above the Ground. This Veil being thus caſt over them, covers their Arms and Face, which they ſometimes remove with their Hands, yet only ſo far as is requiſite to ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. In this manner the Young Ladies of Quality go to Church upon Holy-days, and as for other occaſions of going abroad; they are Strangers to them.</p>
                     <p>This Veil hath ſomething of Majeſty in it, and becomes them very well that do not cover
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102922:154"/>
their Faces with it. The Young Ladies of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that deſign to be Religious, wear it in that manner ſome time before they renounce the World; the ſame Veil is the uſual Dreſs of the City Ladies. The Courtiſans are forbid the Uſe of it, however they ſometimes wear it to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit the Honeſt Women, and deceive. Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: The <hi>Venetian</hi> Ladies wear it ſometimes <hi>en deſhabillee,</hi> eſpecially when they are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Devotions: I remember ſome Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Preachers exhorted them to the Uſe of it, at leaſt in the Time of <hi>Paſſion</hi> Week, during which they frequently go to the Sermons that are Preach'd upon that extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>The Reports of thoſe prodigious high Shooes or Pattins, that the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ladies wore not long ſince are really true; for the Daughters of the laſt Doge <hi>Dominica Contarini,</hi> were the firſt that freed themſelves from this intolerable Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some of them were at leaſt two Foot high; ſo that they <hi>ſeem'd</hi> like the Statue of <hi>Coloſſus</hi> rather than Women, as not being able to ſet one Foot before the other, without the help of two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to lean upon. It is much to be ſuppoſed that the Policy of the Husbands introduced this Faſhion, with which they are ſaid to be very well pleaſed; for an Ambaſſadour diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing lately with the ſame Doge, and ſome of his Counſellours at the Aſſembly of the Palace, before they went to the Chappel, fell upon the Uſe of theſe extravagant Engines deſignedly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, That theſe little Shooes were undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly much more Commodious; to which one of the Councellors replied with an Auſtere
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102922:155"/>
Meen, and twice repeated it, They are indeed too Commodious, <hi>Pur tropo Commodi, pur tropi.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>THE Young Nobility have uſually no other Buſineſs than to go, if they think fit, upon Sundays and Holy-days, to the Great Council, as alſo to appear at the <hi>Broglio,</hi> if they have any Parties to make; the reſt of their time is a great Burthen to them, which they commonly ſpend in ſerving of the Ladies, for ſo they call their way of making Love: It is however but of late Days that the Nobility have applied themſelves to Court the Ladies, formerly they only frequented the Courtiſans, among whom they diverted themſelves with leſs trouble.</p>
                     <p>I do not know if the contrary proceeds from the Ladies having more liberty than they were formerly allowed; or that the Fair Sex is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs ſevere, or probably the Nobles may have judg'd it more advantagious to make their Addreſſes to the <hi>Gentledonna</hi>'s, than continually to frequent the Society of the Publick Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans: However it is, there is ſcarce, at preſent, a Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> Married, or Unmarried, that does not moſt diligently engage himſelf to the Service of ſome Lady, and who does not ſeek all Opportunities of ſeeing her in Publick, for he cannot expect to have free acceſs to her Habitation, or to ſee her without danger, but at
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102922:155"/>
the time of ſome Publick Diverſion; or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in private, when the Correſpondence is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and no more to be done than to take proper Opportunities for the execution of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; but the frequent Maſquerades are the moſt aſſured and moſt favourable Junctures that our Lovers meet with at <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the ſevere Reſtraint of the Ladies <hi>Gentledonna,</hi> and the many Precautions of their Husbands, and their Brothers in Law, who are ſure to be their moſt diligent Obſervers; as likewiſe the Vigilancy of the Servants, who are here ſtrictly required to watch all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Wife, whoſe Husband ſuſpects her Conduct; it is moſt certain notwithſtanding all theſe and many other Precautions, that Perſons of Quality ever find ſome opportunity of making their Paſſion known. A Lady in this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot chooſe but reſent the Capriciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Husband, or the Reſervedneſs of her Parents, which deprive her of the ſmall Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that the Cuſtom of the Country permits to People of her Quality, and conſequently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to have a faithful Waiting-Woman, or ſome other Affectionate Servant, who out of Compaſſion, Friendſhip, or Intereſt, becomes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to her Service, although at the Peril of their Lives.</p>
                     <p>When a Gentleman deſigns to ſerve one of thoſe Ladies, that go freely to the Courſe, the Church, and the Parloirs of the Nuns, he then begins to ſhew himſelf very Aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at all thoſe Places, he is ſure to be ſeen by her as ſhe comes and goes out of her <hi>Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo;</hi> he purſues her with his Eyes, and places
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102922:156"/>
himſelf at ſome diſtance, where in that ſilent Language he acquaints her with his Paſſion, which no Body perceives beſides her ſelf; this great Aſſiduity, and the Language of the Eyes, are the only Means a Lover hath at firſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain himſelf<hi>:</hi> As this manner of Converſation is not unknown to the <hi>Italian</hi> Ladies, ſo they are not long in comprehending the Meaning of it. The Gentleman then endeavours to know if his Service be acceptable to her, by making ſeveral Signs in obſerving of her, as raiſing up of his Hair, putting his Hand to his Face, or taking out his Handkerchief; and if the Lady anſwers to theſe particular Expreſſions by a Motion of the ſame Nature, he is no more to queſtion her good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, for without any other Declaration, the Intelligence is eſtabliſhed between the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that addreſs themſelves to Ladies of a more eaſie Acceſs, and who are us'd to Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of this Nature, make uſe of a leſs tedious Method; but when they are indiſpenſably o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to obſerve all theſe Meaſures, the firſt thing which the Galant does after he hath hopes of Succeſs, muſt be to gain the Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Woman, whom the Lady dextrouſly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes to him from the reſt by affecting to Talk with her in Publick. There is nothing that a <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentleman will not do in theſe Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he immediately applies himſelf to her Father, Mother, her Friends, or Relations, whom he obliges either through Fear, or Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to bring him to ſpeak with the Woman. But to engage this Creature to advance his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts with her Lady, he mingles his Preſents
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102922:156"/>
with Threats and Embraces; but they are eas'd of this trouble when the Lady finds her ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Gallant; for in thoſe Occaſions ſhe is never backward in making the neceſſary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to her Woman.</p>
                     <p>If the fear of danger to which theſe Waiting-Women expoſe themſelves by rendering Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Nature to the Wives of thoſe Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands that do not underſtand Rallery, ſhould abſolutely engage them to refuſe the Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He muſt then take other Meaſures, he forces the poor Creature to quit the Service of her Lady, and as they are wonderfully adapted to all the Contrivances of Addreſs in this Affair; ſo they are ſure to introduce ſome other, whoſe Services will be more effectual, whereby it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes happens through the violent proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome of theſe Gentlemen, who make it a Point of Honour to ſurmount the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Obſtacles, that not only the poor Waiting-Women are neceſſitated to render the Services deſired of them, but even the Ladies themſelves find it neceſſary to have a forc'd Complaiſance for theſe Dangerous Lovers.</p>
                     <p>After the Gallant hath eſtabliſhed the ſecret Commerce with his Miſtreſs, he is ſure to be punctually informed of all the Places this Lady deſigns to viſit, which are uſually the Churches, and the Parloirs of the Nuns, where the Noble never fails of paying his Attendance; and that he may be more likely to ſucceed, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours by all manner of ways to render the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Nun the Friend of his Miſtreſs, Advocate to his Suit; for at <hi>Venice</hi> it is no Novelty to find thoſe retired from the World, perfectly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102922:157"/>
to enter into the Confidence of ſuch Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; by this means Letters paſs ſecurely, the Flowers and other Preſents are made, which the moſt quick-ſighted Husband can never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
                     <p>As it is nevertheleſs impoſſible for a Noble to ſerve his Lady, without the Knowledge of his <hi>Gondoliers,</hi> who are the perpetual Witneſſes of his private Tranſactions, ſo he makes them to ſettle a Friendſhip with thoſe of the Lady; from this Intelligence, which is confirmed by ſome little Intereſt, the Gentleman receives all the Inſtructions, Lights and Services that can poſſibly be deſired from theſe ſort of People, who are extremely faithful to the Nobility in ſuch Junctures; provided they are none of thoſe <hi>Gondoliers</hi> which Jealous Husbands have plac'd with their Wives, particularly to inform them of all their Proceedings, and even what <hi>Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>'s ſeem moſt to follow them at the Courſe, and all other Places.</p>
                     <p>When our Lovers do not meet with thoſe Obſtacles that are not to be ſurmounted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty, they are not long before they find the means of ſeeing each other by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral different Methods. This is the great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment not only of the Young Nobilty, but likewiſe of ſuch as are Married; yet what is moſt to be admired, is that the Jealouſie which every where elſe makes Rivals bcome the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies of each other, oftentimes produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the moſt Tragical Effects, ſeems here to be of no force, and intirely to have loſt her Sting; for here at moſt ſhe operates only by an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Hatred, which in all other Places, is carried
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102922:157"/>
to the height of Reſentment. But the Genius of this People does not engage them to proſecute that Method of Revenge which is too frequent with the Nobility of other Countries; beſides, the <hi>Republick</hi> gives her utmoſt Endeavours to impoſe Silence to their Diſputes, and to take up all Quarrels at their firſt breaking out: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over theſe Gentlemen chooſe rather to reſerve their Revenge for the next Balloting, than to enter into the Liſts of Danger upon Subjects of Gallantry.</p>
                     <p>Be it Wiſdom, Policy, or Moderation in Matter of Love, as indeed it may be ſo thought by the ſhort continuance of it, theſe things do not in reality proceed to that height they might<hi>:</hi> Moreover, as there is no handſome Lady that is not followed by ſeveral Lovers, ſo theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are not of a Humour to be treated with Contempt or Partiality; for there is nothing more certain, than that the deſire of receiving ſome Favours from their Miſtreſſes, is a more probable reaſon for theſe Proceedings, than any real Love they have to them, which is plain by the Revolutions incident to theſe Matters, as likewiſe by the Liberty they afterwards take of publiſhing the Favours they have received, which muſt ſeem to any Impartial Perſon to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Demonſtration of the Vanity of their Paſſion.</p>
                     <p>However great that the Danger is which the Ladies expoſe themſelves to, by correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Deſires of the Nobles, ſeeing the Example of ſuch as have been Poiſoned by their Jealous Husbands, are not to be ſtruck out of their Memories, yet they are not always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102922:158"/>
to reſiſt the Aſſiduities of a Courtſhip, that in ſome meaſure amounts to a great Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or at leaſt they would, by continuing Obſtinate, be comeexpoſed to as imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. In ſhort, Can one have a more lively In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Truth of this Matter, than thoſe Methods which ſome Noble Gentlemen purſue to attain their Deſires, who make it no ſcruple to take the Advantage of a Lady's Secret Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and thereby either induce or force her to admit of their Addreſſes, unleſs ſhe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chooſes to expoſe her ſelf to the certain loſs both of Life and Reputation?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SAbellin</hi> reports, That the Ancient Cuſtom of <hi>Venice,</hi> was to ſet up their Daughters by way of Auction, who were delivered to them that offered moſt: This Cuſtom was very Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Beautiful, their Charms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd them many Purchaſers, who endeavour'd to out-bid each other by offering very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sums for the Preference: And that the leſs Handſome might not remain Unmarried, they wiſely applied Part of that Money they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the Beautiful, to paſs off thoſe now mentioned, to whom Nature had not been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently liberal of her Graces, to acquire them Lovers without any other Conſideration. But this Cuſtom, it ſeems, did not continue after the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Republick;</hi> and if at preſent we obſerve ſomething ſingular in their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102922:158"/>
Marriages, it is the Method which is yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times practiſed among the Nobility.</p>
                     <p>Can any thing in reality be more extraordinary, than to have two People of one Town, and of a like Condition, enter into the Bands of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, without ever ſeeing one the other? This is nevertheleſs ſo free from Fiction, that in the time I was Writing theſe Obſervations, a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was concluded between a Gentleman that bears one of the greateſt Names of <hi>Venice,</hi> who after the Ratification of the Marriage Articles, was yet near upon a Month without knowing what ſort of a Lady he had Married; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Ancient Cuſtom, after all Matters are agreed upon, the Young Gentleman is to make Love for ſome time, <hi>A la mode de Veniſe,</hi> by paſſing to and again under the Windows of the Lady, at ſome certain Hours in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Fair One then appears at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow both to ſhew her Self, and to have a full View of him.</p>
                     <p>The Gentleman I am ſpeaking of, by what he had heard, knew very well that he was not to expect much Beauty with his Lady<hi>:</hi> Inſomuch that the firſt time he began to perform this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony in his <hi>Gondolo,</hi> he perceived among ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others at the Window, a Face very far from being agreeable; upon which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, That if ſhe was the Lady deſigned him, Patience was to be his Support, for he could not have any thing worſe: Yet it ſeems this Home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſon was poſted there, that his Spouſe might afterwards be leſs diſagreeable to him; for when he knew that it was not her who had appear'd ſo horrible in his Eyes, he thought
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102922:159"/>
there was reaſon ſufficient to be contented. The Perſon whom this Gentleman intruſted with the Diſcovery, and the Progreſs he every Day made in the Courſe of his Amours, did her ſelf aſſure me of the truth of theſe particular Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which ſeemed to me not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of being mentioned in this Place.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Cuſtoms reſtrains the Engag'd Spouſe from waiting upon his future Wife, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he carries her the Necklace of Pearl, which he is oblig'd to give her; theſe firſt Meetings of Perſons that never did ſee each other before, have frequently given occaſion to ſuch extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Eruptions, that one can hardly conceive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing like them: This generally proceeds from the Solitary Lives of the Ladies, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably from the Company of their aukward Wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Women, with whom they perpetually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe for want of better Society; inſomuch that the Uncouthneſs of their Natures are rarely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed either by Education, or good Company. I remember one, who in this juncture thinking the Gentleman at firſt ſight that was to be her Husband, very ugly; cried out, without min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Matter; <hi>O what an Ugly Face is there! How, am I to ſpend all my Days with thee? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly I ſhall take care what I do: O che bruto Muſo! Mi ho di ſtar centi? Ohito.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She was not the firſt that in theſe Occaſions made this ſort of Compliment to her Husband; nevertheleſs theſe Ladies who are ſo fierce at firſt, do no ſooner enjoy the Liberty of ſeeing the World, which the Quality of Wife then allows them, but they immediately change that Conduct for Engagements infinitely more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102922:159"/>
I mean by ſhewing themſelves rather than ſeeing the World; for the greateſt part only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ſeen, without ever enjoying the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Viſits and Converſation, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify the Mind, and mightily help to correct the Imperfections of the Body.</p>
                     <p>Although there are many Brothers in a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet ſeldome above one of the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Marries; to the end they may preſerve their Riches intire; and he that enters into this Engagement, is ſeldome the moſt hopeful of all the Brothers, or the more like to attain the principal Dignity of the State; whether the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conſider the troubles attendant to Families as obſtacles that muſt divert their Application from Publick Affairs, in which they place their greateſt Honour and moſt important Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, or that they find ſufficient Pleaſures in thoſe unreſtrain'd Lives they lead, which they eſteem amply equal to the Pleaſures of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, is not to be determin'd by me: But moſt certain it is, that they are very willing to charge the Care of the Family, upon him they judge moſt proper to perpetuate the Name of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>This Cuſtom has been the occaſion of that Scandal which is ſo ready to every Body's Tongue, as believing, That the method of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> is for one Brother to Marry for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of all the others<hi>:</hi> I can affirm, this is not ſaid without ſome Reaſon. Yet it would be of very little purpoſe to ſearch out any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this matter. For all ſuch as know the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, will eaſily agree, That thoſe Perſons who make the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102922:160"/>
Debauchees to paſs for acts of Gallantry, are not to be credited in their Opinions, unleſs their Sentiments ſeem ſufficiently ſtrenuous to make us ſubmit our Faith in favour of what can at moſt, be but barely believed. A Gentleman ſaid one Day to a Woman of Intrigue, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a <hi>Gentledonna</hi> famous at <hi>Venice</hi> for her extraordinary Beauty, <hi>That it muſt be a great ſatisfaction to ſerve a Lady of ſo much Merit</hi> She replied without Heſitation, <hi>There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done; Perra la gha quatro cognai in caſe, for that there were Four Brothers in Law at home with her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Nobility is permitted by the Laws of the Republick, to Ally themſelves to the Families of Citizens, to Marry the Daughters of the Glaſs-makers of <hi>Murano,</hi> as likewiſe of thoſe who Work in Rich Silks of Gold and Silver-Tiſſue; by reaſon they do enjoy, as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerv'd, the Privilege of Citizens: In this manner the <hi>Repuhick</hi> gives the Decaying Families frequent opportunities of Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Fortunes, by Marrying thoſe Women where want of Quality is recompens'd in the great Summs they bring to their Husbands: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they do not only render the Citizens more Affectionate by theſe Alliances which unite them in Blood, and common Intereſt to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; but likewiſe in Honouring theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, they make their Commerce Flouriſh, and the City Famous in Foreign Countries; ſo the <hi>Repullick</hi> does hereby continue to preſerve the greateſt Advantage emaining to them, which is their Reputation.</p>
                     <p>If a Gentleman Marries any other Perſon, the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102922:160"/>
Iſſue is deem'd Ignoble; the Order they obſerve is ſo exact and rigorous in avoiding of all Abuſes of this Nature, That a Noble of the Firſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would not be excus'd, if he does not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the time limited by the Law, which is only a few Days to thoſe Reſiding at <hi>Venice,</hi> appear before one of the <hi>Avogadors</hi> with two Witneſſes, to affirm, That this Gentleman has had by ſuch a Perſon his Wife, according to common Fame, a Child call'd by ſuch a Name. After this Formality the <hi>Avogador</hi> Records it upon the Golden Book: Without which, however Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate the Child of a Noble may be, having all other requiſite Marks of Lawful Extraction, yet it will not be eſteem'd for Noble <hi>Venetian.</hi> He will be debarr'd from entring into the Great Council, until he is Re-inveſted with the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Qualities, which is not be done without ſo much Difficulty, Trouble and Expence, that there are even at this Day ſeveral Branches of the Nobility of the Firſt Order, who are reduc'd to the Order of Citizens, by their Childrens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ommitted to be inſerted into the Golden Book within the Terms limited.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102922:161"/>
a particular famialiarity with the Tranſactions of ſome Monaſteries-</p>
                     <p>Of Four and thirty Convents of Nuns at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> above half of them Live according to the Rules of other Places. Of thoſe Monaſteries whoſe Rules do not oblige them to a Life ſo much retir'd from the World, there are Seven or Eight particularly which admit only the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Gentledonna</hi>'s; the others are fill'd with Perſons of different Qualities.</p>
                     <p>As the Convents in which the Nuns are <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledonna</hi>'s, do eſteem themſelves infinitely above the others; ſo there are likewiſe a much greater number of brisk Ladies, handſome and very agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, withal extremely delighted in the familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they maintain with the Town. The other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries not being in that Conſideration, which a Nobility without mixture acquires to the firſt; nevertheleſs are never without having ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd <hi>Gentledonna</hi>'s and Citadine's, who are no ways inferior to the former: It is a difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to meet with any of the Young Religious in either of theſe Convents, who will not as to her own particular ingeniouſly own, That ſhe is purely become engag'd to that Life, through the Obedience ſhe had to her Parents deſire, or from being plac'd there from her very Childhood; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that if one entertains them with the Thoughts of coming out, they commonly make their Anſwer, <hi>Magari,</hi> that is, very willingly, if it were poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Upon telling theſe Religious they are under Vows which oblige to a quite different Life from that of the World; many of them will ſay, They know not what the Nature of a Vow is<hi>:</hi>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:102922:161"/>
And ask you, If their Hearts could be capable of forming ſuch real Intentions, at the time they were forc'd to ſhew their Compliance? Some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours being us'd to perſwade one of theſe Nuns, That by Virtue of the Habit ſhe wore, ſhe was engag'd to a Courſe of Life directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to what ſhe obſerv'd. <hi>Very well,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I wear this Habit here becauſe my Friends will give me no others; but if I could have thoſe that are made after the variety of the faſhion, I would more readily wear them than theſe I have on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When one conſiders according to the true ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Religion, the Irregular Lives of moſt of theſe Nuns, I muſt confefs the Diſorder ſeems ſtrangely deplorable; but on the other Hand, by regarding theſe Perſons as Ladies of Quality who never had a Vocation to the Condition they are in, and that do not prefer the Convent to the Houſes of their Friends out of any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than for the Liberty they enjoy there, as being permitted to ſee whomſoever they pleaſe; it may be alledg'd, That they are not to be ſo ſeverely Cenſur'd, as other Women in Religion that might chance to lead the ſame Courſe of Life. Moreover ſuch as eſtabliſh any Commerce with them, eſteem them for a ſort of Young Women whoſe Parents do rather chooſe to throw into theſe Places, than to be their Guardians in the World; for here they are ſure to ſpend their Lives with much more Diſcretion, than poſſibly they might in any other Condition: This Conjecture baniſhes all difficulties that might be made againſt Courting of them, ſo they likewiſe are no ways offended in hearing themſelves agreeably Complimented, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102922:162"/>
that familiariny with the World, which in moſt other Places is only us'd by ſuch as are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly engag'd to it.</p>
                     <p>No People are ſo well acquainted with Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Matters, or the Gallantries of particular Perſons, as they really are. There are ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Amorous Intrigues, wherein they have not ſome ſhare, or to which are not at leaſt Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, for upon this Topick of ſecrecy they place their principal Point of Honour and even to adminiſter their beſt Offices and more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Endeavours, between the Gentlemen of their particular Acquaintance and ſuch Ladies as are either their Relations, or their intimate Friends. As they frequently preſent their Friends of both ſorts with variety of Preſents, Flowers and thoſe ſort of things, ſo by the means of theſe Preſents, our Lovers convey their Letters and Tokens to the Ladies without giving any manner of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Nuns who have Brothers keeping Courtiſans, do rarely miſs taking the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Maſquerades in the <hi>Carneval</hi> to bring theſe disguis'd Young Women to their Parloirs, where they take much Pleaſure in entertaining them with the Advantages they have of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Friendſhips of their Brothers, they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale and Careſs them with Tenderneſs, even ſo far as to call them their Siſters. One ought not to be much ſurpriz'd at this proceeding, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe Nuns who are Exemplary for their good Lives, and whoſe Conduct is free of all reproach; yet having made ſome ſort of intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with Gentlemen that are Strangers, they do expect to be inform'd of their Gallantries, and if
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102922:162"/>
theſe Gentlemen own an Affection to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Lady, they earneſtly deſire the ſight of her, to whom they expreſs all the Civilities imaginable; and ſhew by their little Preſents the eſteem they have for the Gentleman, whoſe tendereſt Affections they have acquir'd.</p>
                     <p>No Places are more frequented than the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loirs of theſe Nuns; notwithſtanding the ſeverity of the Magiſtrates againſt theſe Monaſteries, yet the Nobbes that frequent them, are not to be kept from making their continual Viſits. As there is not a Pretty Young Nun that has not variety of Gallants, ſo all the vigilance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions of the Lady-Abbeſs, ſerve only to make theſe Young Creatures more Ingenious in finding of Expedients to try their Lovers. I do remember upon this occaſion, That an Old Aunt chiding her Niece for having anſwer'd to the Aſſiduties of an Enamour'd Noble, who ſtood a great while in the Church to obſerve her at the Grate of the Choir, where ſhe often appear'd, becauſe ſhe was not permitted the liberty of the Parloir as ſhe deſir'd; was only anſwer'd, <hi>That it was the leaſt thing ſhe cou'd do, to avoid being thought Uncivil and Ingrateful to a Gentleman that Honour'd her with his Service.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One of the things moſt inconvenient to the Religious is the openneſs of their Parloirs, that is, there are ſeveral Grates in one, or ſeveral Rooms into which all People go without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the coming away of Company there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. But when they hear how we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in <hi>France</hi> with the Nuns in ſeparate Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loirs, they do acknowledge, That ſuch Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies would be extremely agreeeble to their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102922:163"/>
Humours. In <hi>Carnaval-time,</hi> the Parloirs are the Rendevous of the Maſque, and the more they are Buffoon and Ridiculous, the better they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. The Young Gentlemen make it their endeavours to Diſguiſe themſelves as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly as poſſibly they can, and then go from Convent to Convent diverting of the Nuns with a Thouſand pleaſant Cajoleries. The Lady-Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſes ſometimes appear, to get both the Maſques and the Religious to retire; but as theſe go away of one ſide, ſo they return again on the other; in the mean while the Maſques Play their Tricks, which oftentimes makes the Abbeſs Laugh, and forces her to retire with the Flock.</p>
                     <p>Upon the laſt Days of <hi>Carnaval,</hi> one ſees at the Grate of ſome of theſe Monaſteries, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Religious diſguis'd in the Dreſs of the Faſhion; ſome I have ſeen in Mens Cloaths, with Feathers in their Hats, and playing the Gallant in ampleſt order. I knew a Noble <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> that had ſo great an Engagement for a Beautiful Religious, That when he went to ſee her he took his Place in the Parloir as ſoon as it it was opened in the Morning, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd with his Head againſt the Grate without ever ſtirring until the entrance of the Night, and without either Eating or Drinking, unleſs a Biſquet, or ſome ſuch thing which the Nun might chance to get him. But to maintain a Converſation of this length the Lady-Abbeſs muſt be deceiv'd, by the diligent watching of her Friend or principal Confident, who are ever ready to render their Friends the like Services in ſuch Junctures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:102922:163"/>
The greateſt part of theſe Nuns go no oftner to the Choir than they think fit, they Riſe and go to Bed when they pleaſe, frequently enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining each other with what their Acquaintance ſend them, which oftentimes amount to entire Meals and Collations; that their induſtrious Friends get paſs'd into the Convent. By this it ſeems as if the Incloſure only diſtinguiſh'd them from People in the World. Notwithſtanding the Scandal which this may occaſion, and the Stories that are told of ſome Nuns, who have had the Curioſity to ſee the Opera, and that they found the means of doing it: Yet I am apt to beleive that theſe are Untruths, and that the other Liberties they enjoy, which are of ſmall Conſequence at <hi>Venice,</hi> have been the occaſion of ſaying more than the Truth in this matter.</p>
                     <p>One can ſee nothing more ſingular or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable, than the Habits of Five or Six ſeveral Orders of Nuns at <hi>Venice;</hi> for inſtead of Vail, Fillet and Biggin, they have only a Forehead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth of fine white pleated Gauſe, ſomewhat like thoſe that are in <hi>France</hi> worn upon Mournings; with a little Biggin of fine pleated Linnen that covers the Top and Hind-part of the Head, rhe two Ends of which meet under the Throat, their Hair comes out behind, which is Cut ſo as to fall about the upper part of their Necks; they have their Hair on the Forehead uſually Curl'd, and oftentimes Enamel'd Buckles in their Ears for Pendants.</p>
                     <p>In moſt of the Monaſteries their Habits are of white Camblet, and their Bodies are ſtiffened, a ſort of fine black Crape is ſow'd round about the upper part of their Bodies; this is brought
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102922:164"/>
ſtraight down before for the advantage of the Shape, which is likewiſe no ſmall Grace to the Neck, that is almoſt wholly expos'd to the Eye. The Necks of their Shifts are of the fineſt Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen and ruffled at Bottom, they come only a little below the Elbow, where being ty'd with Ribbans they have the appearance of Ruffles. As theſe Ladies are extremely Neat in their Linnen, the gayeſt of them being never without Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, which they faſten before them, or in their Boſoms; ſo it muſt be acknowledged that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be of a more agreeable effect to the Eye.</p>

                     <p>I Do not pretend to ſpeak of the Original Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Venice,</hi> for thoſe who are deſirous to inform themſelves farther than what is mention'd in the Beginning of the Second Part of this Treatiſe, may find that Matter in other Works examin'd to the Bottom: I only Deſign to ſay ſomething of that Liberty which is at <hi>Venice</hi> ſo much in every one's Mouth, even from the meaneſt of the People to the firſt of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators; <hi>Somo a Venetia, We are in a place of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> Which is frequently the Anſwer for the Incivility of the one, and the Inſolence of the other ſort, who are oftentimes wanting in the Reſpect they ought to have for ſome Perſons, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they are not Noble <hi>Venetians.</hi> For the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think when they have done what becomes them in this matter to the Nobility, that they are not oblig'd to have a Deference to any others whoever they are.</p>

                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:102922:164"/>
I ſhould be mightily embarraſs'd if I were to give an exact Definition of the Liberty of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> for it does not only comprehend the Free Condition of all the Subjects of the <hi>Republick,</hi> eſpecially for the People of <hi>Venice</hi> to follow without reſtraint whatſoever may contribute to their Pleaſures, provided they are not incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the Publick Good; but likewiſe this very Liberty comprehends in thoſe occaſions where the Authority of the Government is not prejudic'd, an intire exemption from Puniſhment, the deficiency of that Reſpect which is due from Inferiors to Superiors. True, it ſeems to me that this Liberty of <hi>Venice</hi> is properly a Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Libertiniſm, advantageous to the <hi>Republick,</hi> convenient to the Nobility, and agreable to the People; who are not ſenſible that this Liberty which they pretend to have above thoſe People that are under a Monarchy, is in reality but a vain Chimera.</p>
                     <p>What has been already ſaid, ſufficiently ſhews their manner of Living, as alſo what are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Occupations and Inclinations of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Nobility. Therefore in the remaining Part of this Treatiſe, I will endeavour to give a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Draught of the real Genius of this People; yet not ſo as to enter into the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of all ſorts of Conditions; believing that upon this Subject of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Liberty, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough may be ſaid in general, to ſhew in what manner they Live at <hi>Venice,</hi> and how every one may Regulate himſelf by the Dictates of his own Fancy.</p>
                     <p>Upon Obſerving of the Religious we ſhall meet with thoſe Irregularities of Conduct that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102922:165"/>
are no where elſe to be found, and the Reaſon of it is, becauſe they cannot expect to eſcape ſo eſialy as at <hi>Venice:</hi> Beſides as to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> no Prince is ſo much engag'd in Intereſt, to aſſure himſelf of the Religious, by the means of a Liberty that takes from them the Eſteem of the People, and conſequently brings them into a more abſolute Dependance than can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd by a Soveraign Authority: That the greateſt part of the Eccleſiaſticks are only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary for the Scandal they occaſion to their Orders. And as they are generally, of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Extraction; ſo there are very few Houſes of the Nobility, where one of theſe Prieſts do not Execute divers different Employs; moreover, it is very rare to hear of an unfortunate Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and a Prieſt not concern'd in the Buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be deny'd, but that there are many Curates of an Irreproachable Life, who are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſpute ſufficiently qualify'd to procure ſome Moderation in theſe Publick Diſorders, if the Evil was not Originally without Remedy<hi>:</hi> However when the Reformation of Manners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends only upon the Paſtors, it is much to be ſuppos'd, That for one who ſhall have the Zeal and Abilities neceſſary to perform it, there will be many whoſe Engagements lying directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Application of their Duties, will make but a very indifferent progreſs in any Works of this Nature. The Liberty of <hi>Venice</hi> makes every thing Authentick, for whatſoever the Life is, or Religion one Profeſſes, provided, you do not Talk, or Attempt any thing againſt the State, or the Nobility, one may be ſure to Live unmoleſted, for no Body will go about to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102922:165"/>
Cenſure their Conduct, or to oppoſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of their Neighbours.</p>
                     <p>If any tender-conſcienc'd Perſons ſhould be deſirous to remove a Courtiſan out of their Houſe or Neighbourhood; they would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to accompliſh it without alledging ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beſides the Scandal and bad Example of it; for they take ſo little notice of things of this Nature, that it is nothing extraordinary to ſee a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> Living in the Firſt Story of a Houſe and a Courtiſan in the Second, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly this may be ſome Place of Publick Buſineſs, which the Noble no ways eſteems as inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to him: Herein conſiſts the reality of this Liberty of <hi>Venice;</hi> yet nothing renders the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of this People more eaſy, than to ſee there is no Diverſions at <hi>Venice,</hi> which is not in common between them and the Nobility; for they mingle themſelves with thoſe of that Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Body at all Ceremonies, and other Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Rejoycings without any manner of conſtraint; and theſe Gentlemen of their ſides require no ſort of external Reſpect from them, which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy produces all the good Effects that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be expected from ſuch a Conduct.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider the Country-People, we ſhall find them ſenſible of this Liberty; for beſides their being in a manner almoſt exempt from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and free of all Military Quarterings: yet they do moreover find the Government of the <hi>Republick</hi> extremely eaſy, by reaſon their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtates being only for a ſhort continuance, and their Adminiſtration ever liable to a Retroſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, detains them mightily from making the People uneaſy; therefore the Conduct they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102922:166"/>
is ſo much to the contrary, That they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affect the moſt Popular manner, and even to allow free Acceſs to their Palaces whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they pleaſe, which ſtrangely gains their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: They behold alſo with much Pleaſure the Nobility of <hi>Terra Firma</hi> that are ſo very proud of their Quality, to be not only treated with the ſame meaſure that is us'd to them; but even worſe, for thoſe Gentlemen rarely meet with leſs ſeverity than the Senate thinks it intirely their Intereſt to diminiſh their Power; inſomuch the People of the Provinces and thoſe of the City are equally poſſeſs'd, That they cannot be more Happy than they are under the Government of this <hi>Republick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Famous Liberty draws Strangers hither in Multitudes, where the Pleaſure and Diverſions of the Place as ſure empty their Pockets. Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes and other Perſons of the greateſt Quality are frequently there; for that conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Cuſtom of being <hi>Incognito</hi> joined to the Charms of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Liberty do mutually engage them to purchaſe their Pleaſures at ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Rates. The late Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer the Name of <hi>Marqueſs de Salluces,</hi> was there a conſiderable time, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd mighty conſiderable Summs: The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> makes ſeveral Journeys hither in the Pleaſant Seaſon of the Year, beſides which he never miſſes a <hi>Carnaval;</hi> but he Lives in ſuch a manner at <hi>Venice,</hi> as it plainly appears he does not much apply himſelf to what ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable to the Rank and Dignity of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince.</p>
                     <p>The Princes of <hi>Brunswick</hi> had a Furniſhed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102922:166"/>
Palace at <hi>Venice</hi> before the War, in which they uſually paſs'd the Winter: It is affirm'd, That in the time of Fifteen or Sixteen Years, they ſpent at leaſt Twelve Millions of Crowns, and that the Banker who made theſe Remittances got at leaſt Five hundred thouſand <hi>Livres</hi> for his own ſhare, with which he afterwards Purchas'd the Dignity of Noble <hi>Venetian;</hi> and theſe are the Principal Franchiſes of this ſo much boaſted Liberty.</p>

                     <head>Of the Courtiſans.</head>
                     <p>MAny of thoſe who know <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> are at a loſs which of theſe two Cities is the moſt Libertine, and moſt plentifully ſerv'd with Courtiſans. For my one part I am certain nothing can be equal to what is Practiſed at <hi>Venice,</hi> both as to the great number of Perſons and the ample liberty which every one takes without the fear of being troubled for it. To ſay the truth, the Character of Courtiſan ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sentiments of the People, does ſomething diminiſh the Credit of them that profeſs it, yet on the other ſide this Character is ſo far advantagious as it acquires to them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration proportionable to the Quality of thoſe that frequent them: And as there is not a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſan who does not ſhelter her ſelf under the name and protection of ſome Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> which they ſometimes do at an extraordinary Price; ſo this renders them reſpected by the meaner People, who Envy more their good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, than they have Averſion to the Trade they Profeſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:102922:167"/>
Two hundred and fifty four Years ſince <hi>Venice</hi> being deſtitute of Courtiſans, the <hi>Republick</hi> was oblig'd to procure and encourage the coming in of Foreign Women. <hi>Doglioni</hi> that writ the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Tranſactions of <hi>Venice,</hi> does here much amplify the Wiſdom of the <hi>Republick,</hi> who by this means provided againſt the frequent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, that were daily made upon the Perſons of many Modeſt Women; for even the moſt Sacred Places could not be eſteem'd as aſſur'd Sanctuaries, and in which the Chaſtity of the Women were out of all danger. Therefore as the <hi>Republick</hi> ſeem'd to believe that the Sea-Air render'd this Diſorder habitual and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, ſo they judg'd it neceſſary to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe bad effects in permitting the uſe of Courtiſans, as likewiſe by eſtabliſhing an Order, whereby they might contribute to the mutual Support of each other.</p>
                     <p>The Conduct of all theſe Bonny Laſſes was committed to the direction of an Honourable Matron, to whom was depoſited the Profits they made by their Calling, who every Month diſtributed the Sums ſhe thought neceſſary for them, allowing each of them proportionable to the Merits of what ſhe earn'd. This prudent Conduct has ſo well eſtabliſh'd the Courtiſans, that the <hi>Republick</hi> need not fear <hi>Venice</hi> will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want them for the future. All the Streets and Canals are abundantly ſupplied with theſe ſort of Ladies; who commonly ſtand at their Windows and Balconies ſet out with a mighty profuſion of Ribbans, where they expoſe their beſt Charms to excite the Inclinations of all paſſing by them; butas they have the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102922:167"/>
of being the Handſomeſt of all <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo they have that alſo of beſtowing thoſe Preſents which are not ſoon to be forgotten.</p>
                     <p>The Daughters of the Common People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom there are a great many Pretty Creatures, are the Nurſery that ſtocks the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans: For the Young Nobility Living in Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, place their greateſt Diverſions in finding out thoſe from among theſe Young Women that are moſt agreeable to their Fancies; endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Perſwaſions, Promiſes and Money to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to deliver up what is deſired of them. The Gentlemen that are able to pay for their Pleaſures chooſe the Handſomeſt of them, whom they endeavour to have at Eight or Ten Years Old: Theſe are carefully elevated as Fruits which they Deſign to pluck, when at the height of Perfection. But as moſt of theſe poor Creatures do at length find themſelves betrayed in their Hopes, are at laſt reduc'd to take up the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Publick Courtiſans</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman thinks himſelf no ways ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a Perſon that has treated him with the laſt Complaiſance, if he aſſociates to their Commerce ſome ſubſtantial Merchant that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes handſomly to her Maintenance, and his Equivalent is Pay'd in the Protection he gives her. Thus they divide between them the Days of the Week, alternatively enjoying their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures without any mixture of Jealouſy. But theſe Gentlewomen moſt commonly grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Conſtraint they are oblig'd to Live in, being much Delighted to be Courted by others, as Perſons of Merit; that ſo they may make a better Hand of their Favours, or poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102922:168"/>
ſenſible of ſome new Tenderneſs treſpaſs upon the Friendſhip of thoſe that Maintain'd them: So they are not only Abandon'd, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſee themſelves ſtrip'd at once by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of whatſoever might contribute to their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Eſtabliſhment.</p>
                     <p>When a Young Woman goes privately from her Parents to yield her ſelf up to the Lover, ſhe is eſteem'd very fortunate if the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Citizen that Debauch'd her, makes ſome ſmall Proviſion for her Maintenance. The whole conſiſts in ſome Poor Lodging that he Hires hung with Gilt Leather, a few Cloaths, and a ſmall Weekly Allowance. This is the Fortune of theſe Young Women, who are yet Envy'd by all others of their Condition. From whence it happens that although one hears e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day of thoſe Rapes; yet being with the Conſent of the Women, they are thought no ways Criminal, ſo it is only call'd <hi>Menar via una puta:</hi> Such of the Young Wives as are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with their Husbands, or that love their Diverſions, are ſometimes ſeen to do the ſame thing. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Avagadors</hi> are the Judges of theſe Diſorders; yet it is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for the Parents or Husbands to obtain Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary Satisfaction, when a Noble is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it.</p>
                     <p>To ſpeak the Truth, there rarely happens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Proſecution upon theſe Matters; for of Ten Young Creatures that engage into this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Nine of them are Proſtituted by their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Aunts, who may receive One or Two hundred Ducats as the Price of their Childrens Virginity, which they ſay, is to Marry them
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102922:168"/>
after the time of the Agreement is expir'd. I was once by chance at a Treaty of this Nature. A Foreign Gentleman of my Acquaintance had been ſometime Bargaining for a Young Woman; the Aunt at laſt brought her to him, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to give a poſitive Anſwer; alledging, That the Young Woman was not as then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Furniſhed, nor her Neck come to the Perfection he deſired: The Aunt told him plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That he was not to make any farther ſcruples-about the buſineſs; for the Father Preacher of one of the Firſt Convents of</hi> Venice, which ſhe Nam'd <hi>was in Treaty for her, and had already made very Conſiderable Offers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As this Libertiniſm cannot be particular to the Nobility only, without infuſing the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into all other Conditions; ſo it comes to paſs, That all Citazens, Tradeſmen and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have (in regard of their Pleaſures) full Liberty at <hi>Venice</hi> to do what they pleaſe; yet they are to avoid all ſuch Places which the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Gentry reſerve to themſelves; for by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe they might chance to be made ſenſible of that Intruſion: But the Nobles agree very well among themſelves as to the matter of Keeping, for if Two of them are not able to Maintain a Woman they like, which Society is term'd <hi>Farcaſa,</hi> than each of them brings in his Friend to the Partnerſhip, that ſo they may render the Charge more eaſie. I have known Three Gentlemen in Treaty about a Woman for a Year together, before they could ſettle the Conditions of the Bargain; yet what is more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, one of theſe Nobles was Marry'd to a <hi>Gentledonna</hi> of one of the beſt Houſes of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102922:169"/>
                        <hi>Venice,</hi> and is likewiſe one of the Richeſt of all the new Created Houſes: However he Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated himſelf to the others, which looks as if he did expect to find thoſe Pleaſures more agreeable being divided than in particular.</p>
                     <p>Their whole Society uſually conſiſts in theſe ſorts of Extravgancies. They meet at the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans, where they Divert themſelves by all manner of means; pretending, That by Living thus in Common, they have no reaſon to be jealous, and conſequently enjoy their Pleaſures with leſs inquietude: But as it is difficult for ſuch a Licentious Voluptuouſneſs to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with one ſort of Exceſs; ſo it is not hard to believe thoſe who affirm, That the Courtiſans are employ'd to ſuch Infamous uſes, that notwithſtanding all the Charms of Enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by their extraordinary Laciviouſneſs ſuch as frequent them; yet it is impoſſible but that ſo much Lewdneſs muſt create in moſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of Averſions.</p>
                     <p>Where there is ſo much Diſorder and ſuch a general Corruption, it is not to be admir'd that the Diſtemper which uſually follows this Vice ſhould be generally ſpread; I do not ſay, only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Courtiſans, who are almoſt all infected with it, but likewiſe among the Marry'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of which number I muſt leſs except the <hi>Gentledonna's</hi> than the Wives of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty: The reaſon of it is, the Young Nobility and the Marry'd Nobles being equally addicted to this exceſſive Lewdneſs; ſo they muſt neceſſarily ſhare among them the Trouble which this Diſorder produces. As the one makes no ſcruple in communicating to their Ladies what they have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102922:169"/>
acquir'd by their Ungenerous Proceedings, ſo the others pay the Favours they receive from their Miſtreſſes with Preſents of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whereby it happens this Corruption is, in a manner, here Univerſal.</p>
                     <p>It may be eaſily imagined from what has been ſaid, That there is ſcarce a City in <hi>Europe,</hi> where this Diſtemper is ſo common. I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by my own particular knowledge that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral New-marry'd <hi>Gentledonna's</hi> miſtaking this Diſtemper for Indiſpoſitions uſual to Women, have been reduc'd to a moſt Deplorable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without knowing what it was, until the virulency of the Illneſs, and the nature of the Remedies they took, did at length acquaint them with the truth of their Diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Republick</hi> does not think She ought to Rectify theſe Diſorders or ſtop the progreſs of ſo much Libertiniſm. But on the contrary She eſteems it for an Evil that is advantagious to the State, which like a Lethargy ſtupifies the boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Blood of their Youth; not only enervating the Vigour of them whoſe Impetuous Natures might be dangerous, but it likewiſe empties the Purſes of ſuch Strangers, who come in great numbers to <hi>Venice</hi> for the love of Her Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pleaſures. Moreover the People being edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in Softneſs, are not deſirous of any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Government: So the Nobility being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely addicted to the purſuit of their Pleaſures, are not diſtruſted of meditating Novelties that might be prejudicial to the State, but expect without impatience the Places and Dignities which Age and their Qualities Intitle them to in the <hi>Republick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:102922:170"/>
As there is nothing more certain, That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the particular favour of the Almighty, the Vices of Youth follow Man to the Grave; ſo it is no wonder if the moſt Venerable Heads of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility do continue to obſerve the ſame Habitude: They are ſo little Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in things of this nuture, and ſo extremely open in theſe Practices; that the Husbands make no difficulty to ſay, they are to Dine with their Courtiſans that Day, and their Wives are to ſend them what they order to be brought upon ſuch occaſions: I ſhall rather leave it to be imagin'd than to expreſs here, thoſe Baſe and and Extravagant Artifices that theſe Reverend Heads uſe as Incitements to thoſe Pleaſures, which the natural weakneſs of their Ages yet deprive them from taſting.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Matter at the Place where I begun it, I ſhall add, That the Condition of a particular Courtiſan is ſo little prejudicial to her Reputation who only Abandons her ſelf to one Perſon, that if ſuch a Young Woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires from that Life, and Marries, ſhe is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eſteemed free of all Reproach. In theſe Hopes ſeveral Young Caeatures deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Inclinations, but it is rare to ſee them retire; for their Lewdneſs join'd to that Liberty which they ſo much eſteem, as being free from the Conſtraint they were forc'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Parents; are indiſſoluable Bonds, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them to a Profeſſion that is actually Honoured by Daughters of Noble Families.</p>

full of Strangers of all Nations, but the greateſt part of them whom Curioſity brings hither find themſelves deceiv'd in their Expectations; for the Beauties of the <hi>Carnaval</hi> doe not as they imagine conſiſt in the Magnificence of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Publick Shows, or in the Pompous Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades that are oftentimes ſeen in ſeveral other Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> Therefore it is ſomething difficult to ſay preciſely, from whence proceeds that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem which is ſo generally conceiv'd of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval;</hi> yet I am perſwaded that an infinity of things concur to the rendering of it Famous; particularly the Cuſtom of aſſuming any ſort of Diſguiſe, the great Liberty which all Maſques every where enjoy, the inviolable Reſpect that is ſhewn them, and the great number of Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which are then at <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more ſingular, than to ſee in a manner all the City in Maſquerade, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers carrying in their Arms their little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Diſguiſe: Such of both Sexes as go to the Market, or to the Haberdaſhers for Six Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-worth of Tape, are ſure to be in Maſque. The Place of Saint <hi>Mark</hi> is the great Theater, upon which is to be ſeen the chief Appearance of the <hi>Carnaval;</hi> for there is ſcarce a Maſque in <hi>Venice</hi> that does not come here about an Hour before Sun-ſet, inſomuch that the great Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Place is barely ſufficient to receive them and others that come to ſee them. The <hi>Gentledonna's</hi> do not only Diſguiſe themſelves to partake of the Diverſions in the laſt Days of the <hi>Carnaval;</hi> but ſuch as have Intrigues do at this time by a Thouſand different ways deceive both Husband and Guards: For there is hardly any
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102922:171"/>
or Houſe which is not in a manner open to the Maſques; whereby this time of <hi>Carnaval</hi> ſeems to be the Seaſon in which the Gallants get in the Harveſt of their Amours; for in this juncture are gather'd all the Fruits of thoſe Intrigues that have been in ſuſpence during the other leſs favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Seaſons. New Correſpondences are ſettled even with the Ladies moſt narrowly watch'd, by taking the exacteſt and moſt probable means for the long Continuance of them.</p>
                     <p>The length of the <hi>Carnaval</hi> which begins after <hi>Chriſt-maſs</hi> Holy-Days, is one of the things that contribute moſt to render it agreeable. 'Tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe impoſſible to expreſs what a Conſternation there is throughout the whole City, eſpecially of ſuch Perſons that wait with impatience the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Advantages of this Seaſon; when One of the Preſidents of the Council of Ten, either through Capriciouſneſs or poſſibly ſome other Motives, forbids the uſe of Maſquerade or at leaſt reſtrains the appearance of them to the laſt Days of <hi>Carnaval</hi> only. As this Order takes away the greateſt part of the Pleaſures of the Seaſon, ſo it may be ſaid, That it is very rare notwithſtanding the frequent threatnings to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the Execution of it; eſpecially if ſome Reaſon of State do not particularly oblige the Council to it. However they are always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go in Maſques to the Banque's, the Opera and Comedy.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carnaval</hi> is likewiſe the principal Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Courtiſans. They Dreſs themſelves very Neatly in their Diſguiſes, in which they appear upon the Place of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> where they endeavour to Contract new Familiarities.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102922:172"/>
Yet a great part of them are Hired or retain'd for the whole time of the <hi>Carnaval,</hi> ſeeing he cannot expect to paſs for a Man of Gallantry, that has not ſuch a Companion in this time of Diverſion, in which it is accounted Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to appear with a Lady at the Opera, Play-Houſe, Ball, and all other Places of Diverſion.</p>

                     <p>WHen the Evening puts an end to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of the Place of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Ridotti</hi> begin; theſe Places being ſo call'd where the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility keep an open Bank againſt all ſuch as are deſirous to try their Fortunes at Play. There are ſeveral of theſe Banks at <hi>Venice</hi> which the Nobility fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent all the Year round; but the Great <hi>Ridotti</hi> of the <hi>Carnaval</hi> is in a Houſe near the Place of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> to which reſorts a great deal of Company when the Diverſions of the aforeſaid Place are over. They ſcruple at letting any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that are not in Maſquerade, for that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is reſerv'd to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a counterfeit Beard, Noſe, or any other thing that cauſes an alteration in the Face is ſufficient; and ſuch as are not deſirous to Play may take it off if they pleaſe when they are in.</p>
                     <p>There are a great many Sconces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a Hall and ſeveral other Rooms of the ſame Floor, round which are plac'd a great many Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to each of which there is a Noble who ſits on that ſide next the Wall to keep the Banque: Before each of them there are Two Candles, ſeveral Packs of Cards, a Cup full of Gold-Pieces,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102922:172"/>
and another of Silver-Ducats. In this manner they ſit ready to receive all ſuch as are willing to Play, either Maſques or <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentlemen. The Crowd is ſo great that very often one can hardly paſs from out of one Room into another; nevertheleſs the Silence here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd is much greater than that in the Churches: Strangers are much ſurpriz'd at this Spectacle, which is infinitely more admirable for the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, then diverting in its Pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>The Game play'd here is <hi>Baſſet</hi> only, which was unknown in <hi>France,</hi> until Signior <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani</hi> now Ambaſſador for that Republick very lately brought it into faſhion at <hi>Paris:</hi> Since which it is become ſo common as to need no Deſcription here; it being only uſed with this difference at <hi>Venice,</hi> that neither the Noble who deals, or the Maſques that Play do ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change any Words with each other. The Young <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentlemen commonly chooſe rather to Play, than to keep the Banque; but to ſee in how much Tranquillity and Gravity very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Summs are loſt, is really ſo very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; that one would almoſt think this is a School, to learn the Art of behaving one's ſelf with Moderation in the Alternatives of Fortune, rather than a Place of Diverſion and Gaming,</p>
                     <p>A Noble Man very rarely continues to keep the Banque for a whole <hi>Carnaval,</hi> ſo the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are ſucceſſively undertaken by different Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who are not all equally good Gameſters, for ſome loſe and others get Conſiderably; but thoſe that love Play and are well acquainted with <hi>Venice,</hi> do generally know which are the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102922:173"/>
Nobles that have the Reputation of being the faireſt Gameſters: For however equal this Game ſeems to be, yet there are ſeveral Gentlemen ſo very dextrous in cutting and drawing the Cards, that the moſt intelligent and quick-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Player may be ſometimes deceiv'd. As the Perſon who Plays may heap what Summ he pleaſes without any exception by the Noble that Deals, ſo he may leave off after he has acquir'd a conſiderable Summ, at once or by length of Play, to which the Noble has no other remedy than biting his Fingers and ſaying to himſelf, <hi>La maledetta Maſchara.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gentledonna</hi>'s frequently Play at the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotti without any other Diſguiſe than that of a Velvet-Viſard, whereby ſuch as know them Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd have not much trouble to do it here, ſeeing nothing of their Necks or Shapes are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: Here are many ſorts of Liquors and Ices for the Accommodation of the Ladies; in which there are likewiſe convenient Places for the Dreſſing of all ſorts of Victuals, that lie expos'd and ready for the Spit, to engage ſuch as wait upon the Ladies at the Opera and Play-Houſe, to divert the remainder of the Evening with the Collation-Pleaſures which are uſually taken in theſe Places.</p>

                     <head>Of the Opera.</head>
                     <p>THE invention of <hi>Opera</hi>'s is due to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Venice.</hi> Although they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly particularly fine, yet <hi>Paris</hi> at preſent ſurpaſſes whatever can be ſeen here of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It was not at firſt imagin'd that theſe Compoſitions could agree with the Genius of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102922:173"/>
the <hi>French</hi> Language, which is almoſt natural to the <hi>Italian;</hi> and in reality, if it had not been for that able Maſter who firſt undertook it, who was no leſs <note place="margin">Lully.</note> Familiar with all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Italian</hi> Muſick, than with thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies of the <hi>French,</hi> if it had not been I ſay for his great Experience, in making thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Compoſitions which are ſung in two ſuch different ways, it may be believed, that this Noble and Magnificent Diverſion would not have been attended with that Succeſs which it has ſince had both at Court and in Town.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> they Act in ſeveral Opera's at a time: The Theaters are Large and Stately, the Decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Noble, and the Alterations of them good: But they are very badly Illuminared; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines are ſometimes paſſable and as often ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; the number of Actors is very great, they are all very well in Clothes; but their Actions are moſt commonly diſagreeable. Theſe Opera's are long, yet they would divert the Four Hours which they laſt, if they were compos'd by better Poets, that were a little more converſant with the Rules of the Theater<hi>:</hi> For in this matter their preſent Compoſitions are very deficient, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much they are frequently not worth the Expence that is made upon them. The Ballets or Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings between the Acts are generally ſo pittiful, that they would be much better omitted; for one would imagine theſe Dancers wore Lead in their Shoes, yet the Aſſembly beſtow their Applauſes on them, which is meerly for want of having ſeen better.</p>
                     <p>The Charms of their Voices do make amends
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102922:174"/>
for all imperfections: Theſe Men without Beards have delicate Voices, beſides which they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably ſuitable to the greatneſs of the Theater. They commonly have the beſt Women-Singers of all <hi>Italy,</hi> for to get a famous Girl from <hi>Rome</hi> or any other Place, they do not ſcruple at giving Four or Five hundred Piſtoles with the Charges of the Journey, and yet their Opera's laſt no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the <hi>Carnaval.</hi> Their Airs are languiſhing and touching; the whole compoſition is mingl'd with agreeable Songs, that raiſe the Attention; the Symphony is mean inſpiring rather Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly than Gaiety: It is compos'd of Lutes, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbos and Harpſicords, yet they keep time to the Voices with the greateſt exactneſs imaginable.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>French</hi> have at firſt ſome difficulty to underſtand their Words, the <hi>Italians</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Strangers have much more trouble in <hi>France;</hi> where they do not only Sing lower, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Words with much leſs diſtinction. The great <hi>Chorus</hi> of Muſick that ſo often fills the <hi>French</hi> Theater, of which one indeed can hardly diſtinguiſh the Words, is very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Italians,</hi> who ſay, That this is much more proper to the Church than the Stage, as likewiſe that the great number of Violins ſpoils the Symphony of the other Muſick, which they think can be only agreeable to the <hi>French,</hi> unleſs it is when they play alone in other Occaſions. Although they allow the <hi>French</hi> to ſucceed very well in their Dances, yet they are of the Opinion, that there are too many of them in their Opera's; whoſe Compoſitions are likewiſe too ſhort for their Fancies, which they think are not ſufficiently fill'd with Intrigues. Their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102922:174"/>
Compoſitions are always concluded with the Character of an Old Woman that gives good Advice to the Young, but falling in Love her ſelf without any probability of a return, ſhe runs into the repetition of a great many pleaſant Fancies.</p>
                     <p>They that compoſe the Muſick of the Opera, endeavour to conclude the Scenes of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Actors with Airs that Charm and Elevate, that ſo they may acquire the Applauſe of the Audience, which ſucceeds ſo well to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that one hears nothing but a Thouſand <hi>Beniſſimo</hi>'s together; yet nothing is ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the pleaſant Benedictions and the Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Wiſhes of the <hi>Gondoliers</hi> in the Pit to the Women-Singers, who cry aloud to them, <hi>Sias tu benedetta, benedetto el padre che te genero.</hi> But theſe Acclamations are not always within the bounds of Modeſty, for thoſe impudent Fellows ſay whatever they pleaſe; as being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd to make the Aſſembly rather Laugh than Angry.</p>
                     <p>Some Gentlemen have ſhewn themſelves ſo Tranſported and out of all bounds by the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voices of theſe Girls, as to bend themſelves out of their Boxes, crying, <hi>Ah cara! mi Butto, mi Butto,</hi> expreſſing after this manner the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of Pleaſure which theſe divine Voices cauſe to them. I need not omit the Prieſts in this Place, for according to the Example of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are no ways ſcrupulous of appearing upon the Stage in all manner of Parts, and by acquiring the Character of a good Actor they commonly get that of an honeſt Man. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member once, that one of the Spectators diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102922:175"/>
a Prieſt in the Diſguiſe of an Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, cry'd aloud, <hi>ecco Pre Pierro, che fa'la vecchia.</hi> Nevertheleſs all things paſs with more decency at the Opera than at the Comedy, as being moſt commonly frequented by the better ſort of People. One pays Four Livers at the Door, and Two more for a Chair in the Pitt, which amounts to Three Shillings and Six-Pence <hi>Engliſh,</hi> without reckoning the Opera-Book and the Wax-Candle, every one buys; for without them even thoſe of the Country would hardly comprehend any thing of the Hiſtory, or the ſubject matter of the Compoſition.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gentledonna</hi>'s frequent the Opera much more than the Comedy, by reaſon the Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that place are expreſs'd with more Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity than thoſe of the other: As they are at this time allowed to dreſs with their Jewels, ſo they appear moſt ſplendidly by the means of the many lighted Tapers which are in thoſe Boxes. Here their Lovers are employed in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of their Charms, and they on their ſide, ſhew by ſome Signs that they are pleas'd with the aſſiduity of their Services: Whenever a new Girl appears to Sing at the Opera, the principal Nobles eſteem it a point of Honour to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of her, and if ſhe Sings well they ſpare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may accompliſh the Deſign of getting her. One of the <hi>Cornaro</hi>'s was upon one of theſe occaſions Rival to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> they both endeavour'd to exceed each other in their Preſents, yet the Charms of her Voice were not accompanied with all thoſe of Beauty: The <hi>Venetian</hi> was ſucceſsful and got the better of the Duke.</p>

                     <p>THE Comedy is only at <hi>Venice</hi> in <hi>Carnaval-time;</hi> however, it ſometimes begins in the end of <hi>October</hi> or beginning of <hi>November,</hi> in which Month one frequently finds here three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Gangs of <hi>Comedians,</hi> each infinitely worſe than the other. The Theaters in which they Act, belong to the Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe of the <hi>Opera's,</hi> from whence they receive very conſiderable Profits; for they let their Boxes at ſuch a certain Price for the whole <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval,</hi> or elſe ſo much a Day. The Profit of the Actors is only what they receive at the Door, which do's not exceed five Pence each Head. The greateſt part of the Audience commonly chooſe the conveniency of being in Maſquerade both at the <hi>Comedy</hi> and <hi>Opera.</hi> Their Dreſs is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Champain-Coat or riding Cloak, a ſort of a Bonnet of a black Taffata upon their Heads, which only permits the ſight of their Noſe and Eyes; over this ſome add a half Vizour neatly made, and cover'd with fine glaz'd Linnen: Thoſe that wear the <hi>Venetian</hi> Veſt with this Diſguiſe are look'd upon for real Nobles, yet the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are rarely in Maſques, either at the <hi>Opera</hi> or <hi>Comedy;</hi> unleſs they are thoſe that dare not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach their Miſtreſſes, nor enjoy the ſatisfaction of ſuch mutual regards, without creating to the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102922:176"/>
Ladies, both troubleſome dangerous Affairs.</p>
                     <p>The young Nobility do not go ſo much to the Comedy to laugh at the Buffoonry of the Actors, as to play their own ridiculous Parts: They commonly bring Courteſans with them to their Boxes, where there is ſuch a confuſion and ſometimes ſuch ſurprizing Accidents, ſo contrary to the Rules of Decency, which are at leaſt due in all Publick Places, that one muſt indeed ſee theſe Tranſactions before he can believe them. One of their moſt ordinary Diverſions is not only to ſpit in the Pit, but likewiſe to pelt them with Snuffs and ends of Candles, and if they perceive any one decently clad, or with a Feather in his Hat, they are ſure to ply him with the beſt of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, which they may do as being free from all notice or puniſhment; for the Nobles that are the Protectors of the Theater, have their Bravo's in diſguiſe at the Doors, who are well armed, and ready to obey Orders: Beſides the <hi>Comedy</hi> and <hi>Opera</hi> are look'd upon as Privilege-places, where the leaſt Violence would be reckon'd a Crime of State.</p>
                     <p>The liberty which they in the Pit take, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Example of the Nobility, do's finally raiſe the Confuſion to its utmoſt height. The <hi>Gondoliers</hi> chiefly do give their impertinent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes to ſome certain Actions of the Buffoons, that would be tolerated in no other Place; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſeldom that the whole Houſe makes ſuch terrible Exclamations againſt the Actors, who are not ſo happy as to pleaſe, that they are forced to retire to be ſucceeded by others; for the continual cry is, <hi>fuora buffoni.</hi> The Gentlemen find this ſo agreeable to 'em, that even they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102922:176"/>
are frequently this hiſſing Party; and if one inquires how it comes to paſs, That they are ſo very prudent and wiſe at the great <hi>Ridotti</hi> where they Game, and ſo extravagantly fooliſh at the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;</hi> you are anſwered, That they ſit at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Place to take the hazards of Fortune, but that they come hither to divert themſelves only; and as Maſters, they are pleas'd to do it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the method moſt agreeable to them.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can equal the Noiſe which is made when a Play has given ſatisfaction to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or to ſpeak more properly to the <hi>Gondoliers;</hi> for when they come to name the Play to be Acted the next Day, that Mob cries out <hi>queſta, queſta,</hi> play the ſame again, which muſt be of courſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd. Whereby one uſually brings away from theſe pitiful <hi>Comedies,</hi> the diſſatisfaction only of having delay'd Supper until nine or ten at Night; yet they ſometimes act ſuch as are very ſerious. Their Compoſitions are in Verſe, and theſe they call <hi>Opera's,</hi> with which they have indifferent good Succeſs. At other times they repreſent ſuch as would not be tolerated by the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> any where out of the Territories of the State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> as that of <hi>Don Giles,</hi> who in the Habit of a <hi>Religious,</hi> preaches againſt the Debauchery to which he abandons himſelf: Yet it is no ways ſtrange that theſe things paſs unregarded, ſeeing the Nobles ſuffer themſelves to be ridicul'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage, in the Perſon of <hi>Pantalon,</hi> who is a real Copy of them, in Habits, Actions, and Words, which he really imitates with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt exactneſs.</p>

                     <p>THere are a great many of theſe little Balls, during the <hi>Carnaval</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> which they call Feaſts, according to the Cuſtom of <hi>Rome;</hi> excepting that at <hi>Venice</hi> the Dancers pay the Muſicians: As the Feaſts occaſion a great Liberty and great Profits to thoſe that make them, ſo it happens that they are either intirely forbidden, or elſe ſuch as would have them muſt have a Permiſſion from the Magiſtrate. Upon which a Houſe is fitted up to this purpoſe, a Lanthorn deck't with Garlands is ſet as the Sign at the Door, where it continues the whole <hi>Carnaval.</hi> A Violin with a pair of Virginals is the Muſick of the Place, which is open to all ſorts of People. Their Dancers are uſually of two ſorts, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times according to the <hi>French</hi> way of Dancing, and ſometimes a Figure-Dance, or ſort of a Brawl, which the little Girls of <hi>Venice</hi> perform to admiration.</p>
                     <p>The Maſter of the Houſe is always preſent to gather in his Profit, to which purpoſe the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments forbear playing, ſo ſoon as the Company has danc'd four or five Rounds, or a <hi>Four lane;</hi> for ſo they call this ſort of Brawl. The Dancers are thus to pay their Acknowledgments, which is about a half-penny <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the Women and Girls that go to theſe Feaſts are always in Maſques, and as they are generally either Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſans or Women of good Qualifications; ſo the Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> take the ampleſt Liberties of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102922:177"/>
theſe Diverſions, by endeavouring to paſs the Hours pleaſantly with the handſome Maſques that are ſometime there, not much regarding the trouble they give thoſe that brought them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The Maſter of the Houſe do's accommodate them with convenient Rooms, as are deſirous to eat and drink, where it is not to be doubted but things of farther moment are ſometimes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, all which little matters do amount at laſt to a conſiderable Profit. Therefore this was us'd to be formerly a particular Privilege belonging to the Servants of Ambaſſadors, who kept thoſe ſort of Muſick-Houſes within the Limits of their Maſters Juriſdictions<hi>:</hi> But this ſhameful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce appear'd ſo ſordid to the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France,</hi> that they firſt forbid the uſe of it to their Servants, ſince which the Example has been follow'd by all others. The Nobles and <hi>Citadins</hi> have oftentimes thoſe Balls that laſt only one Night, to which every Man comes with his Courteſan Maſqu'd; yet only thoſe Perſons that are known are permitted to enter, as it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times practis'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> where thoſe that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent theſe ſort of Night-Dances, are wrapt up in their Cloaks, the long Sword under their Arm, and a dark Lanthorn in their Hand.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THESE Exerciſes of <hi>Hercules</hi> and the Bull-Feaſts, are Sports that are Repreſented in the ſeveral Seaſons of the Year; but ſeeing the <hi>Carnaval</hi> is the chief time for Pleaſure and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102922:178"/>
Sights, ſo they then endeavour to perform their principal Feats of Activity in theſe matters. The common People are much delighted with the two laſt, by reaſon they are of that Body who ſhew them to the Publick, but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Exerciſes of <hi>Hercules,</hi> which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by certain Companies of Artiſans and Boat-Men, who continually Exerciſe themſelves for it: To which purpoſe there appears about twenty young Men, upon a great Scaffold rais'd in ſome publick Place, all of them being clad in cloſe ſtraight Breeches, and little Waſtcoats of <hi>Brocatelle;</hi> to their Garters are faſtned ſome ſmall gingling Bells.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing they ſhew when they mount the Scaffold by an eaſy Aſcent, is one of their moſt agreeable Actions. Each of them carries one of his Companions upon their Shoulders, in a manner very particular; for they that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried have only their right Foot upon the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of him that ſupports them: They incline their Bodies forward, by leaning altogether on the right ſide; their Arms are ſtretch'd out, the one up and the other down; in which manner they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low each other, each of them holding the Heel of the left Leg which he ſtretches out that is carried before them; ſo they ſeem to be along Chain of Men in the Air, who only ſupport themſelves by their Hands and the ends of their Feet.</p>
                     <p>They afterwards obſerve a ſort of Cadence to their Bells, by making of ſeveral Rounds, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at Intervals ſeveral Figures, which in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and poſtures are quite different from each other. Sometimes four underneath, having upon their Shoulders the ends of two Poles, carry eight
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102922:178"/>
up an end to the height of five Men, by including a little Boy, that is over upon the Shoulders of the uppermoſt: Sometimes four of the ſtrongeſt form an Arch of Bodies, with their Stomacks out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſo ſuſtain ſix or ſeven Men upon the tranſverſe of their Bellies. Others having two Men one above the other, upon the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, walk about, ſit them down and riſe with this heavy and tottering Burden. In ſhort, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having repreſented ſeveral ſtrange Figures, by as many different Poſtures, which do not require a leſs ſhare of Agility than a moſt prodigious Strength of Body; they conclude theſe Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are much to the ſatisfaction of the Spectators, eſpecially to thoſe of the People, who like the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> only deſire Bread and fine Shews.</p>
                     <p>The People do not flock in leſs Crowds to the Bull-Feaſts, than to the <hi>Herculean</hi> Agilities. To which purpoſe they ſometimes erect ſeveral Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds round a great Square, or as often a Rail on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for their Bulls are not of the more furious ſorts. Two Men commonly hold them by their Horns with two long Ropes: After this, they looſe their Dogs which faſten with ſo much fury upon their Ears or their Throats, that they would both loſe their Breath and choak themſelves; if they were not ſometimes dextrouſly drawn off. This Diverſion would be very inconſiderable, if it were not for the pleaſant Diſorders that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen by the Bull's breaking looſe from them that have hold of the Ropes; for finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf violently pinch'd by the Dogs, he makes uſe of his utmoſt force, over-turns ſome of the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds,

and ſo brings the whole Company into Confuſion.</p>
                     <p>In the ſame Places they ſometimes entertain the Company with the Diverſion of Bear-Baiting, which ſort of Creatures are particularly kept for the diverſions of the People: Not long ſince a Bear being ſeverely us'd by the Dogs, made a greater effort than could be imagin'd from ſuch a Creature, broke looſe from his Stake, and leap'd upon a Scaffold, which caus'd ſo great a Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſeveral of the Spectators were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly wounded. They ſometimes turn the Bulls through the Streets, but particularly in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval-time;</hi> which is not only to render the Fleſh better, but likewiſe for the Diverſion of the young Nobles, who putting back their Veſts take hold of the Ropes, and run after them, guiding through the Streets thoſe poor Creatures to be torn by the Dogs; the narrowneſs whereof do's ſometimes occaſion the greateſt difficulties to Paſſengers, that meet them at the end of a Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or are otherwiſe unexpectedly met by a Bull enrag'd with the Dogs.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>MAundy Thurſday</hi> is a Day of Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, by reaſon of the Ceremony <note place="margin">Jeudigras.</note> which is at this time perform'd upon the Place of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> in the preſence of the <hi>Seignory,</hi> and the Ambaſſadors of Princes. This great publick Feſtival conſiſts in ſeeing the Head of a Bull cut off, after which they have the Diverſion of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Fire-work, which is but very indifferent; yet what makes it worſe, is, its being performed by Day-light. Then come the Rope-Dancers and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102922:180"/>
Vaulters who ſhow their Agilities upon a Scaffold erected upon the Place over againſt the Gallery of the Palace in which the <hi>Seignory</hi> is ſeated.</p>
                     <p>This Feſtival derives its Original from the happy Succeſs with which the Arms of the <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick</hi> were attended, in the Wars ſhe formerly had againſt <hi>Ulric</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Aquilea,</hi> in behalf of the Patriarch of <hi>Grado:</hi> For the irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hatred of the former having ſeveral times en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd him to take up Arms againſt his Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; the <hi>Republick</hi> had as often recourſe to their Arms, in defence of the laſt, who was not ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful; and having at length taken that Patriarch Priſoner, as he deſign'd to have ſecured himſelf of <hi>Grado,</hi> which he unexpectedly attack'd, he was with twelve Canons, Priſoners with him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to have his Head cut off upon the Place of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> but the <hi>Republick,</hi> as it was thought, left him to expire between two Walls. In his ſtead they cut off the Head of a Bull, and twelve Hogs in thoſe of the twelve Canons.</p>
                     <p>To perpetuate the Memory of this Advantage of the <hi>Republick,</hi> who has ever been very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in preſerving the Memory of all her Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; She Solemnizes every Year the Feſtival of <hi>Maundy-Thurſday,</hi> whoſe Preparations and Pomp do very much reſemble ſome ridiculous Tragedies. All the <hi>Butchers</hi> of the City dreſs themſelves very ſtrangely, with all the fine things they are able to borrow, they afterwards appear at the Place of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> divided into ſeveral Companies; but as they are every one of them arm'd with what they think fit, ſo it is the moſt extravagant Sight imaginable, to ſee ſome with old Halbards, others with great Scymiters, ſome
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102922:181"/>
with Pikes, and others with old faſhion'd Spadons, which they carry naked between both their Hands.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Seignory</hi> comes down into a great Room, that is even with the Galleries of the firſt Floor of the Palace; this pleaſant Militia paſſes in a Re-view before the <hi>Doge</hi> and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors. The variety of their Arms and Habits join'd to the Irregularity of their March, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a Sight the moſt extraordinary in its nature that I ever yet beheld: For ſome run, others march gravely; ſome make their moſt profound Reverences to the <hi>Seignory;</hi> and others ſtrutting by without taking notice of them. All this is perform'd with the Sounding of Trumpets that run a Foot at the Head of each Company; in ſhort, this whole Ceremony reſembles more ſome Popular Emotion, than any Publick Rejoicing.</p>
                     <p>From hence they paſs to the <hi>Piazza,</hi> that go's out upon the Place, where they are no ſooner arriv'd, but he of the <hi>Butchers</hi> to whom the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Execution is deſign'd, with one flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of his Sword ſtrikes off the Head of the Bull, in preſence of almoſt the whole City; the Place, the Palace, the Procuratories, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scaffolds erected on this occaſion, being all full with an infinite number of People, that come hither to ſee the Ceremony, as likewiſe to partake of the Diverſions that attend it, of which the Fire-works at two in the Afternoon ſeem the moſt ſingular. To all theſe is uſually added that moſt agreeable Spectacle to the People, of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man fly down a Cord, which is faſtned to the Steeple of St. <hi>Mark</hi> at one end, and the other to the Galley that lyes between the two Columns.</p>

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:102922:181"/>
At this time all the City ſeems to be in a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confuſion, which continues the reſt of the Week; every one being <hi>Jours gras.</hi> permitted to wear in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, excepting ſome Arms, what ſort of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons he pleaſes; which is by reaſon of the great many Bulls that are Baited in ſeveral Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and afterwards run through the City. One ſees the Populace glittering with Axes, Sabres, naked Swords, great Forks, and Iron-headed Clubs; inſomuch that one can hardly believe but that all the City, of which the Shops are ſhut, muſt be in ſome dreadful Sedition; ſo all ſuch as are any ways apprehenſive of Enemies are ſure to be upon their Guards, theſe laſt tumultuous Days of the <hi>Carnaval.</hi>

                     <p>THE Diverſion of the <hi>Freſque</hi> is not only the firſt of all thoſe which the pleaſant Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brings in; but it is likewiſe the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Ladies and Gentlemen, as it is alſo the moſt ſingular, and the moſt ſurprizing thing that a Stranger can ſee at <hi>Venice;</hi> for ſo they call the <hi>Cours,</hi> and the Evening-Diverſions upon the Waters: It is certain one cannot give it a more proper Name than that of the <hi>Freſque,</hi> for in the greateſt heats of Summer, one is ſure to be free from thoſe ſultry Heats, and clouds of Duſt, that are ſo troubleſom in other Places; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, you are, during thoſe Heats here, ſenſible of a charming Coolneſs; for it would be even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to take this Diverſion in any other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than that of the Spring and Summer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:102922:182"/>
They regularly begin the <hi>Freſque</hi> upon the ſecond Holy-day of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which continues un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Saint <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Day, being one of the laſt in <hi>September.</hi> But as the Ladies do not dreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves every Day, by reaſon moſt of them live ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry retir'd; ſo it comes to paſs that the <hi>Freſque</hi> is only us'd upon Sundays and Holy-days, and ſome particular ſolemn Days of Churches, which the <hi>Gentledonna's</hi> frequent, or upon the occaſion of any Publick Rejoycings, to which the Ladies are Invited: For during the good Seaſon, all theſe Diverſions are ended with the <hi>Freſque,</hi> which is taken towards the end of the Great <hi>Canal,</hi> over againſt the Church of Saint <hi>Jerom,</hi> being this Place is leſs frequented with Barques and other Veſſels: Beſides, ſuch as are deſirous to ſee this agreeable Diverſion, may conveniently ſee it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of the two Keys, which are at this Place of an indifferent length upon each ſide of the Great <hi>Canal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They begin to appear at the <hi>Freſque,</hi> about the three and twentieth hour, that is, a good half hour before Sun-ſet. The Company comes by degrees, and the <hi>Gondoliers</hi> ſhew not their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in the beginning, but make an eaſy way by turning backwards and forwards in the length of eight hundred Paces; but theſe Men, by inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly putting on, or the emulation that always reigns amongſt them, animates them to excite each the other; it ſo happens at length, they paſs with ſo much force and ſwiftneſs, that it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be credited; and the Sweat that comes through their Sattin-Doublets, which they who are in Liveries do generally wear, ſhew plainly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102922:182"/>
they are not leſs wet, than if they had been dipt in the <hi>Canal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not long ſince this Diverſion of the <hi>Freſque</hi> was introduc'd, or at leaſt brought to what it is at preſent: For the Gentleman that firſt eſtabliſh'd it, do's yet enjoy the ſatisfaction of his Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who, for having been the Author of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and ſingular Diverſion, do's certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to have his <hi>Statue</hi> erected in the middle of the Great <hi>Canal:</hi> Such as are not accuſtomed to the <hi>Gondalos,</hi> do not at firſt reliſh the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this Recreation; for when they ſee this part of the Great <hi>Canal,</hi> covered with three or four hundred <hi>Gondolos,</hi> that continually paſs by each other, with an inconceivable dexterity and ſwiftneſs; their Heads run round, and they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they are juſt upon the point of being cruſh't in pieces, and inevitably loſt. In reality, the Sight of a great many <hi>Gondolos,</hi> that are work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one way, and juſt ready to run upon others that ſteer an oppoſite courſe, both of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch good uſe of their Oars, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all in a froth, from the ſwifneſs of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; is enough to make one imagine, that either the one or the other muſt be broke into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pieces.</p>
                     <p>Yet by the Agility and Experience of theſe <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doliers</hi> (upon which the moſt timerous repoſe themſelves without fear of Danger) theſe thin and nimble Boats do paſs like Lightning without hurting each other. The worſt of it is, one is ſometimes a little wet; for the Water being ſo violently agitated and preſs'd between two <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolos</hi> holding a different Courſe, do's frequently fly over ſo unexpectedly, that it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102922:183"/>
in thoſe occaſions to avoid the ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency of it: As the Salt-Water is apt to ſpot any coloured Silks, ſo the Ladies provide againſt thoſe Accidents, by turning up their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt Petticoat. They are generally alone, and attended only by one or two Waiting-Women, at moſt. But thoſe that are particular Friends do oftentimes take this Diverſion together, and leave their Women behind them: When there are four of 'em, they place themſelves at the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Gondolo,</hi> regarding each other like ſpeechleſs Statues; for their principal Employ is to obſerve the Proceedings of the Gentlemen, who do not miſs theſe Occaſions of making a regular Court to their Miſtreſſes.</p>
                     <p>As the Liberty of going to the <hi>Freſque,</hi> is one of the greateſt that Husbands allow to their Wives; ſo it is one of the moſt ſenſible Chagrins for 'em to be debarr'd of it: The Men of Gallantry do not only diſtinguiſh themſelves by the neatneſs of their <hi>Gondolos</hi> and Watermen, but likewiſe by the ſmall and light Bodies of their <hi>Gondolo's,</hi> which are purpoſely made for the <hi>Freſque;</hi> as likewiſe by the charge they are at in getting theſe <hi>Gondoliers</hi> that are eminent for their great ſtrength and Addreſs: For with this Equipage they follow the Ladies where they pleaſe, and at four ſtroaks, without the leaſt appearance of Deſign, are always able to come up with the Boats of the Ladies; for all this good management is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by Signs made to the <hi>Gondoliers,</hi> who dive ſo readily into the Intention of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that it looks as if hazard only had occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned thoſe Meetings.</p>

The greateſt piece of Malice that can be offer'd to a Rival in theſe Junctures, is when he keeps up with the <hi>Gondolo</hi> of the Lady, to open the paſſage with the Head of one's own Boat, and ſo paſs between them. The Ambaſſadors go com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Incognito</hi> to the <hi>Preſque,</hi> that is, with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one <hi>Gondolo</hi> and a Gentleman. Sometimes they appear there in Ceremony with all their Attendance, but then they keep the middle of the <hi>Canal,</hi> with a ſlow motion; for at thoſe times their <hi>Gondoliers</hi> are not to ſhew the utmoſt of their Vigour: Nothing is more curious or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, than to obſerve the dexterity of theſe Men at the two ends of the Courſe, where in all the ſeeming appearance of Confuſion, fifteen or twenty <hi>Gondolo's</hi> ſhall turn at a time with ſo much exactneſs; that notwithſtanding their great Lengths, they are ſeldom or never ſeen to joſtle or run foul of each other.</p>
                     <p>The Courteſans are forbidden to appear at the <hi>Freſque,</hi> unleſs it be upon ſome Day of rejoice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at which time they are permitted to go in Maſques. But all Foreign Gentlemen enjoy herein the ſame liberty with the <hi>Venetian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. All theſe frequent Turns with which our enamour'd Gallants endeavour to ſhew the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity of their Services, are concluded with the Day; ſo this Diverſion generally laſts about an Hour and half at moſt; and longer than this time the ſtrongeſt of the <hi>Gondoliers</hi> would not be able to bear the fatigue of ſo violent an Exerciſe.</p>

                     <p>THERE would be ſome reaſon of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to ſee the ſolemn Feſtivals of the Churches, plac'd among the Publick Diverſions; if the Cuſtom of <hi>Venice</hi> had not converted them into a Recreation, ſo much pleaſing to the Ladies and Gentlemen, as it affords them wherewithal to paſs the Day very agreeably: I ſhall not ſpeak here of the uſual <hi>Holy-days,</hi> nor the Places where the Ladies us'd to hear <hi>Maſs</hi> upon Days of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; as at the <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>A fine Church in</hi> Venice.</note> 
                        <hi>Salute</hi> in Summer, at the <hi>Carmelites</hi> in the Winter, and the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the <hi>Roſary,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> every firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Month; in which Places the handſome Ladies ſeldom miſs appearing, and to ſtay from nine in the Morning until twelve at Noon: For theſe Occaſions are eſteem'd as Permiſſions which they are ſure to enjoy: But what I deſign to ſay here, is ſomething of thoſe particular Feſtivals which are Celebrated with Solemnity, and which for the Noble Entertainment of Muſick, and the great Concourſe of People, are eſteem'd as convenient Opportunities for the Nobles and Ladies to ſee each other twice a Day.</p>
                     <p>The moſt diverting of theſe Feſtivals, are thoſe Monaſteries of Religious Nuns, of Saint <hi>Lawrence,</hi> Saint <hi>Daniel,</hi> Saint <hi>Coſmo de la Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtia,</hi> Saint <hi>Katharine,</hi> and ſeveral others, where thoſe Ladies, eſpecially the <hi>Sacriſtines,</hi> are always Employ'd in making of Artificial Noſegays of Gold and Silver-Thread, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102922:184"/>
of <hi>Points de Veniſe,</hi> to which they add ſome Natural Flowers. They diſtribute a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Quantity of theſe to the Nobles and <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donna's,</hi> and to their particular Friends, to whom they are ſent, ſo ſoon as they come into the Church: And if the Perſon to whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Noſegay, is diſtinguiſh'd by ſome Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, then a Prieſt in Surplice brings it to him, upon a Silver-Plate, with a Compliment from the Nun that ſent it. One ſometimes ſees of theſe Noſegays that are all <hi>Point de Veniſe,</hi> and of a very conſiderable Value.</p>
                     <p>The Churches are always Magnificently A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd, and the Muſick is Excellent; yet theſe are not the Motives which bring hither ſuch a number of <hi>Gentledonna's,</hi> for whom are plac'd in the Church, a great many Elbow-Chairs, in which they remain from Morning to Noon, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from after Dinner to the Hour of the <hi>Freſco,</hi> which always ends the Diverſions of theſe Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days. But as the Ladies talk of one ſide, and the Gentlemen on the other; ſo the Crowd and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is generally ſo great, that theſe Aſſemblies ſhew but a ſmall appearance of Devotion; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in time of Service they entertain the Nuns at the Grate of the Choir, who without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty Treat their Friends with Iced Waters and Liquors, eſpecially in the more ſultry Seaſon.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Feaſts are ſo frequent in Fine Weather, that they who only endeavour to Divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or that love Muſick, may find ſufficient Opportunity of paſſing their Times pleaſantly: But thoſe who are not altogether Strangers at <hi>Venice,</hi> but have ſome Familiarity with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of particular Nobles and Ladies, may be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102922:185"/>
wonderfully diverted, by Obſerving in theſe Junctures the various Perſonages of Lovers; as their Regards, their Actions; and all the different ways of aſſuring the Ladies, they ſerve with the fervors of an exceſſive Paſſion.</p>

                     <p>SUCH as have been delighted in obſerving the ſingular and agreeable Manner of the uſual Dances of the young Women, will not think it ſtrange to ſee this reckon'd here, in the Number of the Publick Diverſions, which in it ſelf appears ſo common. Yet ſeeing this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion do's oftentimes amuſe the <hi>Venetian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; as likewiſe the Ladies, who ſtop their <hi>Gondolos</hi> to behold theſe Dances upon the ſides of the <hi>Canals;</hi> but eſpecially all Strangers, being ſo mightily pleas'd with it: I have thought it not amiſs to ſpeak particularly of this, among the other Diverſions of the pleaſant Seaſon. Upon all <hi>Holy-days,</hi> the Daughters of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People aſſemble in the moſt ſpacious Places of the Streets or Keys, but moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the little Squares of their Quarters. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Common People there being not much leſs liberty between the Men and the Women, the Boys and the Girls, than is uſually practiſed in <hi>France;</hi> ſo theſe Girls are not always the only Dancers.</p>
                     <p>They are very neatly dreſs'd, in a Garb not much differing from Ours: They uſually have for theſe Occaſions, a coloured Silk or <hi>Brocatelle-pair</hi> of Bodice, without Sleeves, a Serge-Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat bound about with a ſmall Galoon, and a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102922:185"/>
Pair of curious white Shoes; the Sleeves of their Shifts are of an extraordinary fine white Linnen, theſe are ſet full and ruffl'd upon the Shoulders; which is no ways leſs becoming to 'em, than the Flowers they faſten to the Treſſes of their Hair, that fall about their Ears. The famous Dancers have commonly a Taffata-Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, little Leather-Pumps, lac'd with a ſmall Silver-Lace, and the Soles extremely thin: In this manner they are moſt commonly dreſs'd, in which they dance to Admiration. Beſides their Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and exactneſs of Time, is no ways leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, than the Exerciſe is agreeable to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</p>
                     <p>Their Muſick is a <hi>Tabor,</hi> which is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Voice of the Perſon that beats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; the Tune is always the ſame: Sometimes two Girls Dance the <hi>Four lane</hi> together, and ſometimes a Boy and a Girl, who ſtanding for a little while oppoſite to each other, move their Feet forwards; making all their little Steps with ſo much eaſe and ſwiftneſs, that although they never have both Feet down at a time; yet it is impoſſible to diſtinguiſh which of the two is either up or down. Afterwards, they caſt off on both ſides, and then turn round contrary to each other; but ſo even, and with ſo much Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that when the Girl pleaſes, ſhe overthrows the Boy that Dances with her, by only holding her Elbow ſtiff at the time they paſs by one another; this is always taken for a particular Favour, as likewiſe for a great Mark of Addreſs in the Girl.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentlemen are not only Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at theſe Recreations, by reaſon of the Pleaſures
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102922:186"/>
they afford 'em; but likewiſe as the moſt eaſy Opportunities of being Familiar with theſe young Laſſes, and afterwards to chooſe from among 'em, ſuch as are agreeable to their Francies: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that theſe Dancings of the young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are a ſort of Market, where the Beauty of the Merchandiſes expos'd, occaſions oftentimes ſuch to Purchaſe, as had no Thoughts of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they came thither.</p>

                     <head>The Feaſt of the Aſcenſion.</head>
                     <p>THE moſt Auguſt Ceremony which is to be ſeen at <hi>Venice,</hi> is that of the <hi>Doge</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſing the Sea, upon <hi>Aſcenſion-Day.</hi> All the <hi>Seignory,</hi> goe from the Palace, according to the Method and Pomp before-mention'd, paſſing through the mighty Crowds of the People; and Strangers that come out of Curioſity to ſee 'em Embark upon the <hi>Bucentaur,</hi> which is brought upon this Occaſion, to the Pillars of St. <hi>Mark:</hi> This extraordinary Veſſel is ſomewhat longer than a <hi>Galley,</hi> but built very high, without either Yards or Sails: The Company that Work this Veſſel are under a Deck, upon which is rais'd an arch'd Room or Cabbin of Wainſcot, finely Gilt and Carv'd on the inſide: This reaches the whole Length of the <hi>Bucentaur,</hi> being ſupported on each ſide by a great many Figures; as likewiſe a Third Row that Supports the middle part of the Roof, which forms a ſort of a Double Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nobly Gilt and Parquetted, with Seats of all ſides, for the conveniency of the <hi>Senators</hi> aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this Ceremony.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:102922:186"/>
The extremity of the Poop, is a Semi-circle, upon which is a ſmall Incloſure, that is raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Foot higher than the other Part. The <hi>Doge</hi> is here Seated, with the <hi>Nuncio</hi> and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>France,</hi> on his Right and Left. The Councellors of the <hi>Seignory,</hi> and the Preſidents of the <hi>Forty Criminals</hi> ſit below them in the ſame Order: However, the <hi>Bucentaur</hi> do's not appear leſs Magnificent without than within; as being almoſt every where Gilt: The Carpet that is ſpread over the whole Length of it, is of flower'd Damask, fring'd with Gold, with Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the ſame between the Gilt Statues that ſuſtain the Roof. The Great Standard of Saint <hi>Mark</hi> flying from the Poop, the other Flaggs of Ceremony, the Trumpets and Haut-Boys at the Head, the Majeſty of the Senate in Purple, and the great Number of Strangers and others that get in, notwithſtanding the Care that is taken to let no Body enter, without particular Leave, do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this one of the fineſt Sights that can poſſibly be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>When this ſtately Veſſel puts off from the Place of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> ſhe is Complimented with the Diſcharge of all the Cannon, and is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the Gallies then at <hi>Venice,</hi> ſeveral Galliots, many <hi>Peotes</hi> which are long Veſſels rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Adorn'd; as likewiſe with an infinite number of <hi>Gondolo's,</hi> that almoſt cover the <hi>Lagune's:</hi> By this means this floating Palace, in which are at leaſt five or ſix hundred Perſons, ſeems to be a Caſtle, that is Built in the midſt of a great many little Houſes, or rather a Huge <hi>Elephant,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd with Herds of <hi>Mice.</hi> They proceed in this Order to the Mouth of the <hi>Lido,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102922:187"/>
a Mile or two into the Sea, which is ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the goodneſs of the Weather; for the before-mention'd Admiral, who is call'd <hi>The Royal Pilot of the Republick,</hi> being anſwerable for the ſafe Return of the <hi>Seignory,</hi> do's take ſo much care, that they are ſafe from all manner of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; inſomuch that I have ſeen them Return im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after their Departure from the Place, upon a thick Cloud that appear'd in the Air. And another time I knew the Ceremony deferr'd, to the Sunday after <hi>Aſcenſion-Day,</hi> by reaſon the Weather was a little Windy.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Bucentaur</hi> is come to the Entrance into the Sea, the Muſicians begin the Ceremony, with ſinging of ſeveral Compoſitions that are particular to this Occaſion. The Patriarch of <hi>Venice,</hi> who attends this Ceremony in a great Boat, gives his Bleſſing to the Sea. Then the <hi>Bucentaur</hi> comes up with her Poop towards him, at which time the Back of the Chair of the <hi>Doge</hi> is taken down, who receiving from the Maſter of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> a plain Gold-Ring, of about two Piſtoles and a half in Value, Throws it over the Stern into the Sea, after having ſolemnly and diſtinctly pronounc'd theſe Words, <hi>Deſponſamus te Mare noſtrum in ſignum veri perpetuique Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minii:</hi> Thus we Eſpouſe thee our Sea, in token of the real and perpetual Dominion which we have over thee.</p>
                     <p>After this, to adorn and beautifie the New Bride, they throw a great many Flowers, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous Herbs into the Sea. This Ceremony has given Occaſion to a Witty Expreſſion here, which is, <hi>That the</hi> Doge <hi>by Marrying of the Sea, ought not to take it amiſs, if he ſhould be ſent to</hi>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:102922:187"/>
                        <hi>lye with his Bride.</hi> Yet I cannot underſtand thro' what Piece of Policy, the Honour of the moſt Illuſtrious Function at <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhould happen to be reſerved only to the young Nobility: For inſtead of the Senators of the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> they ſend only the Under <hi>Pregadi</hi> with the <hi>Bucentaur,</hi> who are thoſe of the Nobles that are admitted into the Senate for their Inſtruction; as having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rights or power of Voting. But poſſibly the <hi>Republick</hi> may imagine, That this <hi>Floating Palace</hi> cannot be intirely ſafe from all manner of Accidents; conſequently, if the worſt ſhou'd happen, the loſs muſt now be much leſs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the State.</p>
                     <p>When the Ceremony is over, the <hi>Bucentaur</hi> Floats up the <hi>Lagunes,</hi> with the ſame Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and ſtops at the Church of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> at the <hi>Lido,</hi> which ſtands on the Shoar, towards the City: Here the Patriarch Celebrates High Maſs, after which, the <hi>Seignory</hi> goe into the <hi>Bucentaur,</hi> and return to the Place of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> with the Salutations of the Artillery and ſmall Shot of the Caſtle at the <hi>Lido,</hi> and the ſame Compliment's are made 'em, by all the Ships that lye between this and the City of <hi>Venice.</hi>

the III. do undoubtedly deceive themſelves, by taking the Acknowledgment of the Power to be the Thing given. I do own, ſeveral regard the Hiſtory of the firſt Riſe of this <hi>Ceremony</hi> as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fabulous; yet ſeeing it is reported by ſeveral creditable Authors, and moreover, being ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently warranted, through the Antiquity of the Tradition; theſe Reaſons will be ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me not to omit mentioning a thing that would be intirely Oppoſite to the Deſign I have undertaken, ſo ſhall proceed to Obſerve here, ſeveral of the moſt Remarkable Circumſtances of it.</p>
                     <p>About the Year 1175. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the III. being violently Perſecuted by the Emperor <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> the II. who had ſet up another, with the help of the Cardinals of his Faction, retir'd pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to <hi>Venice;</hi> where, after he had liv'd ſome time conceal'd, in a Houſe of the Canons Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: He was at length diſcover'd, although in the Habit of a mean Servant. Upon which, the <hi>Doge, Sebaſtian Ziani,</hi> went in Ceremony to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Holineſs, who was thereupon brought to the Palace, where he receiv'd all the Honours that were due to his Dignity. The Emperor was no ſooner inform'd of this Paſſage, but he ſent to acquaint the <hi>Venetians,</hi> That if they did not abandon this pretended Pope, that they muſt expect to ſee the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles ſuddenly flying in the Place of St. <hi>Mark.</hi> And to accompliſh the Menace, he ſent his Son <hi>Otho</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> with a mighty Naval Force: But the Generous <hi>Doge,</hi> to whom Heaven ſeems to have reſerv'd the Glory of the Greateſt Actions, that are to be found in the <hi>Annals</hi> of this <hi>Republick,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102922:188"/>
ſet forth thirty Gallies, which he himſelf Commanded in the Engagement againſt <hi>Otho,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated his Ships, and took him Priſoner.</p>
                     <p>An Advantage of this Importance fill'd the whole <hi>Republick</hi> with Joy. The Pope went to receive the Victorious <hi>Doge,</hi> at the Entrance of the <hi>Lido,</hi> and having Embrac'd him, he preſented him with a Ring from his Finger, telling him, <q>That a Sea, <note n="*" place="margin">Ut omnis Poſteritas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligat Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris poſſeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Victoriae jure veſtram fuiſſe.</note> upon which the <hi>Venetians</hi> were ſo powerful, ought to be ſo ſubject to them as the Wife is to the Husband.</q> However, the Pope not being then able to acknowledge this ſignal Service of the <hi>Republick;</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the <hi>Doge</hi> with the Right of uſing the <hi>Ombrello,</hi> the Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Golden Chair, the Taper and the Candleſtick, that are carried before him, upon particular Days, with the ſame Solemnity as they are before the Pope: He likewiſe preſented him with the Silver-Trompets, and the above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Standards, which do at preſent compoſe all the External Pomp of the <hi>Dogal</hi> Dignity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Otho</hi> was Releas'd upon his <hi>Parole,</hi> which he gave them to return again, in caſe he could not engage his Father to make an Honourable Peace; but he return'd with the Emperor, who found Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Pontifical Garments, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Steps of the Church of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> and as the Emperor ſtoop'd to kiſs his Feet, the Pope is ſaid to have put one of them upon his Neck, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating this Verſe, <hi>Super aſpidem &amp; Baſiliſcum ambulabis.</hi> To which the Emperor reply'd, <hi>Non tibi ſed Petro;</hi> and the Pope made Anſwer, <hi>Et</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:102922:189"/>
                        <hi>mihi &amp; Petro.</hi> As it was upon <hi>Aſcenſion-Day,</hi> that this Prince acknowledg'd the Pope; ſo the <hi>Republick</hi> choſe the ſame Feſtival to Solemnize the Memory of ſuch an Illuſtrious Victory; which is an Authentick Title, that confirms to Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, this Right of Soveraignty, which ſhe has by Arms acquired in the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea.</p>
                     <p>Some Circumſtances of this Account may be queſtion'd; but there is no poſſibility of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Protection which <hi>Venice</hi> afforded to this Sovereign Pontiff, perſecuted by <hi>Frederick</hi> the II. However it be, the <hi>Venetians</hi> do mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Value themſelves, upon the Merits of this Action, which they got Inſcrib'd with Great Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacters, in the Royal Hall of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> as an Eternal Monument of that Important Service which the <hi>Republick</hi> render'd to the <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> upon this Occaſion. For there is to be read the Hiſtory of the Victory of the Famous <hi>Sebaſtian Ziani,</hi> who left to the <hi>Republick,</hi> The Glory of having Conquer'd and Humiliated a great Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; as alſo that of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing the Pope in the Chair of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I cannot but in this admire the Policy of the <hi>Republick,</hi> who have with ſuch Authentick Marks of Acknowledgment, Entitl'd themſelves to a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Right they inſiſt to be due to them in this <hi>Hall;</hi> where it ſeems, that ſo long as the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſo great an Obligation appears upon the Wall; the Holy Chair cannot do otherwiſe than receive the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Republick</hi> in it, and to uſe them (as has been hitherto obſerv'd) with the ſame Marks of Reſpect that are ſhewn to Crown'd Heads. Therefore the <hi>Republick</hi> was never more ſenſibly offended, than when Pope
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102922:189"/>
                        <hi>Urban</hi> the III. caus'd this Inſcription to be ſtruck out, but his Succeſſor had it re-inſcrib'd, which gave occaſion to this Ingenious Paſquinade;

                     <p>
                        <hi>AScenſion-Day</hi> is not only one of thoſe Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals upon which the <hi>Doge</hi> Entertains the Ambaſſadors, the <hi>Seignory</hi> and the <hi>Senators</hi> aſſiſting at the Function; but it is likewiſe that which is perform'd with ſo much more Magnificence, as the Ceremony of the Solemnity upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, is infinitely more conſiderable than the others. Theſe Feaſts are made in a Hall of the Palace, that is on the ſide of the <hi>Doge</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments. At the bottom of this Hall there is a rais'd <hi>Eſtrade,</hi> of about half a Foot high, upon which is plac'd a Demi-Circular Table, that takes up all the breadth of the Hall, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſary Spaces at the end of the two Angles. The <hi>Doge</hi> takes his Place in the middle, between the <hi>Nuncio</hi> and the Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> the ſix Councellors of the <hi>Seignory,</hi> and the three Preſidents of the Criminal of Forty, are on the Right and Left; five on one ſide and four on the other. Theſe Perſons take up the Places of this Table, which looks upon ſix other very large ones, that are down the two ſides of the Hall; at which ſit in order, on each ſide of them, they whoſe Dignities Entitle them to the firſt Places at theſe Publick Ceremonies. Then the <hi>Seignory,</hi> and after them all the <hi>Senators</hi> take their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102922:190"/>
according to the Seniority of their Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>The Tables are before Dinner covered with a Service that remains there the whole time of the Entertainment. Every Body goes to ſee the Preparations of the Feaſt; there being upon each Table, Trophies, Great Figures, Triumphal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Caſtles of white Wax Gilt; as alſo an infinite number of ſmall Diſhes of Fruit, Roots, dried Sweet-Meats, Tongues, prepar'd Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, Counterfeit Pheaſant-Pies, other Birds in Feathers, and other ſuch like things, that are never open'd. The uſual Cuſtom is to have twelve Services by two Diſhes at a time to each Table, excepting that of the <hi>Doge,</hi> to which is brought three, that is, one Diſh at each end of the Table for the Councellors, and a third for the <hi>Doge,</hi> and the Ambaſſadors, which is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon a ſmall Table in the middle of the Hall, a little diſtant from that where his Serenity ſits.</p>
                     <p>Upon Fleſh-Days they intermix the Services, as one of Fleſh and the next Fiſh; to which there are ſo many Carvers as there are Diſhes ſerv'd up to the Table; but he that Carves for the <hi>Doge,</hi> by one of his Squires, the Portions he cuts in a cover'd Plate; that ſo there may be a diſtinction between his Serenity and the Ambaſſadors, to whom the ſame <hi>Ecuyer</hi> preſents them uncover'd. The <hi>Doge</hi> do's ever preſent the firſt Plate of the firſt Service to the Nuncio of the Pope, and the ſecond to the Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> honouring in their Perſons the Princes they Repreſent. The Carvers at the other Tables do take care not to help the Senators, until ſuch time as the <hi>Doge</hi> and the Miniſters are Serv'd. At the Entrance of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102922:190"/>
every one of the Services, the Haut-Boys Play a Tune, and at the Serving up of the Fruit, the Trophies and other Intermiſſes are taken away, to make Room for the other Diſhes of Fruit; among which there is always good ſtore of Roots and Pulſe, to wit Peaſe and Beans in Garlick, and other Rarities of the Seaſon; as, Beans up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Day, Figgs and Rasberies upon <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> Day; but of all things there is never no want of Sweet-Fennel.</p>
                     <p>After the Cloath is taken away at the end of the Dinner, every one is ſerv'd with a Wicker-Diſh, covered with Cut Paper, in which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Paſties of Piſtachio's and Pine-Apples, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome Papers of Sugar-Plums, and dri'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. This is the Preſent which the <hi>Doge</hi> makes to the Gueſts to carry home with 'em. The Nuncio and Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> never miſs doing the ſame. However, the Entertainment upon <hi>Aſcenſion-Day,</hi> is not ſo ſerious as the three others, that are upon the Days of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and St. <hi>Vido;</hi> upon which was Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the Conſpiracy of <hi>Bayamonte Tiepolo;</hi> by reaſon the Junior <hi>Pregadi,</hi> or the young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility aſſiſting at this Ceremony, make ſuch a Noiſe and Confuſion, during the Dinner; even to forget, in ſome meaſure, the Reſpect which is due to the <hi>Doge,</hi> and the Ambaſſadors; not being aſham'd to pelt each other with Oranges, croſs the Hall; as likewiſe to make the Windows clatter with thoſe Salvo's of Sugar-Plums, which every Table gives to each other, at the end of the Dinner.</p>
                     <p>The Old Senators, the Councellors, and the <hi>Doge,</hi> are much delighted with this Gayety of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102922:191"/>
the young Nobles, or at leaſt ſeem to be ſo in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, as not daring to check 'em upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Behaviour. They may ſometimes endeavour to excuſe 'em, when there are thoſe Perſons preſent, who might happen to be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd at ſo much liberty, at which time they palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Matter, <hi>la noſtra giuventa ſta allegramente.</hi> After Dinner, when all is taken away, and every one ſerv'd with his Diſh of Comfits, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Nuncio and the Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> carry away the Services of the little Side-Board-Tables, which were cover'd behind their Maſters, where they had all ſorts of Wine they are uſed to drink; leſt the alteration of them might any ways prove prejudicial to their Healths. In the mean time ſeveral of the moſt Famous Muſicians are brought in, who entertain the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, with all the New Opera-Songs, which are accompanied with a Conſort of Violins, a Harpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, a Theorbo and a Tabour.

                     <p>In the time of the late <hi>Doge Contarini,</hi> they had much reaſon to be weary of this Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Muſick: For they were then not us'd to open the Doors of the Palace, until ſuch time as they had got up all the Plate that was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd at the Feaſt. This Cuſtom was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd through the extreme Covetouſneſs of the Procurator <hi>Contarini,</hi> Son of that <hi>Doge,</hi> who made no difficulty to go about the Hall in a Mask, to ſee that none of the Plate might be diminiſh'd, which was brought from the Tables.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102922:191"/>
Once he detain'd the Company above an Hour more than uſual, whom he endeavour'd to divert with ſeveral tedious Songs, until ſuch time as he had found a Silver-Plate that was miſſing.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this Feaſt upon <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> with more than uſual Rejoycings; they go in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to enjoy the <hi>Freſque</hi> upon the Canal of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano,</hi> where all the Balconies and Windows are full of the beſt ſort of People of <hi>Venice.</hi> As the Ceremony in the Forenoon, notwithſtanding the ſeriouſneſs of it, was one half compos'd of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Maſques; ſo one ſees at the <hi>Freſque</hi> of <hi>Murano,</hi> whatſoever was moſt Gallant at the Nuptials of the Sea; as, abundance of Boats with Trumpets, and very finely Equipp'd, and a great many Strangers in pretty Barques, as alſo the Courteſans, who appear here in Maſques, but very neatly dreſs'd in white, and their <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolo's</hi> cover'd with Roſes. All theſe added to the uſual concourſe of Ladies and Gentlemen, compoſe this agreeable Diverſity of the <hi>Freſque</hi> of <hi>Murano.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Ceremony on the <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> is yet more famous, by reaſon of the Fair that is at this time held upon the Place of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days. That Spot of Ground is quite fill'd with Shops, which are diſpos'd in Rows and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Tents. As the Maſques are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly permitted for theſe fifteen Days, unleſs forbidden upon ſome particular Occaſion; ſo you are certain in that time, to find them here in abundance. The Ladies likewiſe, and all the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of People never miſs being there in the Evenings. All the Diverſions and Rarities of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as Rope-Dancers, Vaulters, Wild Beaſts, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,

with an infinity of ſuch ſorts of things are then at <hi>Venice;</hi> which are kept in little Hutts, upon the remaining part of this Place; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this Feſtival of <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> ſeems rather a <hi>Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> that draws hither againſt this time, a great number of Strangers, who agreeably paſs away theſe few Days of the fineſt Seaſon in the year.</p>

                        <hi>Of the Feaſts and Ceremonies that are us'd at the Marriages of the Noble</hi> Venetians.</head>
                     <p>NEXT to the Diverſions uſual to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Seaſons, I will ſay ſomething of them, accidentally proceeding from different Occaſions: And of theſe I eſteem the dancing Parties of the Nobility, as one of the principal Diverſions of <hi>Venice.</hi> They frequently happen upon divers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, but I will here endeavour to deſcribe thoſe that are obſerv'd at the Marriages of the Nobles, which may at the ſame time ſet forth the moſt remarkable Paſſages in the Nuptial Ceremonies of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility. Yet as it is neceſſary to know in ſome Degree the particular diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Houſes, before one can comprehend their manner of Dancing; ſo you will find that they are generally all after the ſame Faſhion.</p>
                     <p>The Entrance is commonly by a long Paſſage, whoſe Walls are extremely white, without any other Furniture, than ſome Benches of a very white Wood, with Backs to ſupport the Body from the Wall: Theſe Benches are painted in various Colours, as likewiſe the Racks on both ſides, which are furniſh'd with Pikes and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102922:192"/>
more for the Ornament of them than any other occaſion of Defence. The Stairs then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, which lead to another ſort of Gallery, that is over the Entry below: This Place takes up the length of the whole Houſe; there are Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows at each of the Ends, from whence you have a Communication to all the Chambers, both on the Right and Left; for they open into each other, whereby you are enabled to make the Tour of the whole Houſe upon a Level, which may be done ſeveral ways.</p>
                     <p>The Richer ſort of Gentlemen are mightily delighted with Magnificent Furniture, in whoſe Houſes may be ſeen great Quantities of Velvet on Gold-Grounds, others Imbroider'd, Lac'd and Fring'd with Gold. An abundance of fine Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Looking-Glaſſes of great Value, but there are no Beds in the Chambers of the firſt Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is to leave more Room to the great reſort of People that are here upon theſe Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, even in ſpight of the Guards that are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the Doors, to prevent the confuſion and diſorder of a Crowd.</p>
                     <p>The Day of Betrothing being appointed, the firſt Senators, that is, the Procurators of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> the great Sages and others that are their Relations (the Nobility and Ladies being uſually Invited thither) do aſſemble in the Gallery above-Stairs. But before they let in the Crowd at the Door, the <note n="*" place="margin">La Novizza il Novizzo.</note> 
                        <hi>Noviciate</hi> (ſo they call the New-Married People for the firſt two years) appears at this Place, in a <hi>Brocade</hi> of Silver, being led by the uſual Maſter of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, who is the <hi>Dancing-Maſter</hi> that teaches
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102922:193"/>
the Lady the Dances ſhe is to know, according to the Cuſtom of the Country, upon the Day of her Marriage.</p>
                     <p>This Man wears a long Robe, a ſhort Cloak of Black Damask, and a Collar of the ſame; ſo with Hat in Hand, and a grave ſlow Motion, he leads the Spouſe to her Father, where a Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet-Cuſhion is laid for the Lady to kneel, who then deſtres her Father's Bleſſing. In the ſame manner, and upon the ſame Account, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts her to her Mother, and the reſt of her near Relations, which is obſerv'd with ſo much Modeſty and Conduct; that it may in reality paſs for one of the moſt extraordinary things that are to be ſeen at <hi>Venice.</hi> After this, the Maſter of the Ceremonies conducts the Lady to the middle of the Gallery, to give her Hand to the Husband, and there to receive the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Prieſt or Biſhop that is to perform the Function. Whereupon the Married Couple are permitted to Salute, which they pretend to be the firſt Favour that the Gentleman receives in Earneſt of thoſe he is to have the Night after: At this Inſtant the young Nobility preſent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Kiſs with a many agreeable Wiſhes, crying out aloud, <hi>Baſa, Baſa, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Cuſtom of lying together before Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is not practiſed only at <hi>Venice;</hi> for the ſame is obſerv'd almoſt throughout the whole <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical State:</hi> But it is moreover a particular Privilege of the Nobility, or rather a Cuſtom introduc'd from an ample Power of Marrying without any other notice given of the Banes, than the Declaration which is made in the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: For as the Nobles are a ſeparate Body from
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102922:193"/>
the other Members of the State, and the Lords of the Government; ſo no body but they only of that Body, can pretend to enter into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of their Intereſts.</p>
                     <p>After this Ceremony is over, the Violins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to play, upon which they make an open Space in the middle of the Crowd, where the new-married Lady dances alone, two or three ſeveral Courrants, as likewiſe ſo many of this Country-Bourreys. However, I believe they think to do them according to the <hi>French</hi> Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet it is no leſs difficult for us to know their Tunes, than the Steps and the Motions of their Bodies ſeem intirely different from the Liberty and Grace that is Habitual to the <hi>French.</hi> One muſt have been Born and Bred at <hi>Venice</hi> to beſtow one's Publick Applauſes upon theſe mean Performances of the poor Ladies, which are moreover very rarely ſeen to keep time with the Muſick; yet they pleaſe, and the whole Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly uſually cry <hi>Ha balato divinamente.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Ball is thus begun, a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the neareſt Relations to the Lady, takes her by the Hand; ſeveral others do the ſame by the reſt, or greateſt part of the other <hi>Gentledonna</hi>'s; ſo they walk two and two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing from Room to Room, through all the Apartments of the Houſe. There is Muſick in all the Places where the Ball paſſes, but their Tunes are very different, and more proper to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire a deſire of ſleeping, than that of Mirth; for which reaſon, without obſerving either Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or Cadence, they only apply themſelves to entertain the Perſon they have by the Hand: For as the Liberty of Converſation is not a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102922:194"/>
frequently enjoy'd at <hi>Venice;</hi> ſo theſe Balls are regarded as the moſt favourable Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of unfolding their Sentiments, where they make the moſt uſe of their Time, without any thoughts of Dancing.</p>
                     <p>This manner of Walking continues until Night, by reaſon there are ever ſome new Dancers, that are ready to ſucceed to the firſt, who ſeldom leave a Lady that is agreeable to them, until ſhe is either weary, or that they apprehend the two long continuation of it may render their Conduct ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. But the Ladies may well be ſoon tir'd, the Crowd being commonly ſo great upon theſe Occaſions, that one muſt frequently in a manner force their way through it, to paſs out of one Chamber into another: Beſides, an endleſs num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Embarraſments ſtop them at every turn, but eſpecially their mighty long Trains are none of the leaſt Inconveniencies. The <hi>Gentledonna</hi>'s that are not taken up with Dancing, ſit in Elbow-Chairs, that are plac'd round about the Gallery. Such as are not invited to the Feaſt, appear in their Maſques, to the end they may not be ask'd to Dance: And they of the Invited that are not deſirous of it, keep their Glove on their Hand; which is allow'd for a ſufficient Excuſe. And the Nobles that preſent themſelves to the Ladies are not to take the Refuſal amiſs; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they do not Addreſs themſelves to a Lady, unleſs ſhe be without her Glove, which is an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Sign that the Lady will not decline the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; ſince, according to the Cuſtom of <hi>Venice,</hi> it would be a high piece of ill Breeding, for a Lady to give a Gentleman her Hand with the Glove on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:102922:194"/>
The Pleaſures of theſe Balls are only to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility; for Strangers and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in Maſques are not admitted to the liberty of Dancing. However, both the one and the other endeavour to Entertain the Ladies they like, at leaſt they have the ſatisfaction of taking a full View of them; and if they are in Intrigue with them, they endeavour to make uſe of the favourable Juncture; which is very rare, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are too narrowly obſerv'd in theſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Yet during the laſt hour of the Ball, the Maſques are uſually permitted to Dance. It is then that our Secret Lovers make the beſt of the Opportunity; and that they may Entertain their Miſterſſes with more freedom and leſs ſuſpicion, they frequently find the means of expeditiouſly changing their Habits. As there are very few Husbands who are not inquiſitive to know with whom their Wives have Danc'd; ſo there are likewiſe but few of the Ladies, that are not able to anſwer the Impertinencies of ſuch frivolous Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>However, no Body but the Brothers and the neareſt of Kin to the <hi>Gentledonnas,</hi> do aſſume the liberty of talking familiarly with them, who ſit fix'd in their Chairs like ſo many Statues; all the Gentlemen ſtanding at ſome little diſtance from them, while the Maſques and the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers go through the Rows, conſidering with much eaſe the Beauties of the Ladies, as they ſlowly paſs by them: In the mean time they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ply'd with cover'd Cryſtal-Cups of Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, and all ſorts of ic'd Waters. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentry and the Strangers have their Shares of theſe Liquors; but for the Entertainment of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102922:195"/>
others, there is a ſeparate Chamber. In this manner theſe Marriage-Feaſts continue, for the ſpace of two Days, that is, from two in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, until the Hour of the <hi>Freſque</hi> in the Evening; and in Winter they Dance by Candle-Light, until it is Supper-time.</p>

                     <p>WHEN the <hi>Republick</hi> thinks fit to Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Prince or any Foreigner of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with a Publick Sight, it is uſually with the Diverſion of the <hi>Regate;</hi> that is, a Tryal of Skill is appointed between ſeveral ſorts of Boats. Theſe are the beloved Holy-days, and the Darling-Diverſion of <hi>Venice;</hi> for the Uſe of the Oar is ſo much the <hi>Genius</hi> of the People, that every one in a manner applies himſelf to it; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the greateſt part of the young Nobility, not only through the deſign of ſhewing their great Strength and Addreſs, but that they may upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Occaſions be able to diſpenſe with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their <hi>Gondoliers,</hi> eſpecially in thoſe Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions that are perform'd beſt without Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. When a conſiderable <hi>Regate</hi> is deſign'd, there is order'd a certain number of middle and leſſer ſiz'd <hi>Gondolo's,</hi> with as many <hi>Fiſolero's,</hi> which are ſo very ſmall and light, that they may be eaſily carried upon a Man's Shoulders. Theſe Matches are commonly for three of each ſort of theſe Boats, one with four Oars, the other of two, and the the third but one: The diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102922:195"/>
renders the Shew very pleaſant, which is yet more, for the greater number of Matches.</p>
                     <p>They who ſtrive for the <hi>Regate</hi> or Prize, of the <hi>Gondolo's,</hi> endeavour to chuſe them that are the lighteſt and beſt Built, from whence they take all the Furniture; even ſo much as the two Irons at the ends: They Scrape and Tallow her, and ſometimes uſe Soap, to render her way thro' the Water more eaſy: Yet leaſt theſe disfurniſh'd Boats might chance to open, through the great ſtreſs of the Action, they faſten a Rope very ſtrongly from the Head to her Stern; nailing croſs her ſeveral light Triangular Plates, which mightily preſerves her from the Violence of the Agitation. They that have the Management of the other ſort of Boats, do uſe the like neceſſary Precautions, as likewiſe to prepare themſelves for it, with Exerciſing their Bodies, and trying their Boats.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be finer than the Great <hi>Canal</hi> upon which they Row theſe Matches. The Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conies and Windows of all the Houſes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, are Adorn'd with rich Carpets and Cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and fill'd with mighty numbers of People: The Roofs of the Houſes, the Bridge of <hi>Rialto,</hi> and a prodigious number of <hi>Gondolos</hi> and Barques on both ſides are cover'd with People: In this manner appear'd that <hi>Regate,</hi> which Cardinal <hi>Delfino</hi> made not long ſince for the Cardinal <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi,</hi> notwithſtanding he was then at <hi>Venice Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnito.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To render this Diverſion the finer, ſeveral of the Young Nobility ſet out certain <hi>Peotes:</hi> Theſe are long Barques, that have a Deck of Planks, upon which are ſpread Carpets of Damask, or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102922:196"/>
Turkey-Work, that reach even down to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Ten <hi>Gondoliers,</hi> all clad in the ſame Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have the working of theſe Veſſels, which they ever do ſtanding upright; and the two or three Nobles that are at the Expence of the Boat, lye in Masques upon the Cuſhions that are at the Head, attended by ſeveral Trumpets in the Stern. The great Number, and the variety of the <hi>Peotes,</hi> are the principal Ornaments of theſe Sights; which are always made in fair Weather. The Boats that are to Row for the Prizes do meet at that end of the City neareſt the <hi>Lido,</hi> where thoſe that are Equipp'd for the ſame Match, lye rang'd in a Line, from whence they give way upon the Signal that is made them by the Trumpets.</p>
                     <p>It would be no great Diverſion to ſee the Boats that contend for the Prizes, paſs alone with much ſwiftneſs; but the <hi>Peotes</hi> which in a manner fly through the Water, do preceed the reſt, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate all Embaraſſments that would be otherwiſe continually happening. The great number of Four-Oar <hi>Gondolos;</hi> the multitudes of Boats fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them; the perpetual Acclamations of the People, to animate the Contenders in Emulation of each other, and to ſhew their utmoſt Strength and Addreſs. All theſe added together, do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make one of the moſt extraordinary Sights that can poſſibly be ſeen. The length of this Courſe, is from the place before-mention'd, to the end of the Great <hi>Canal,</hi> where, in the midſt of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there is a great Pile Erected, round which they are oblig'd to paſs, returning with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Expedition to the Palace; for here the Prizes are diſtributed to them who firſt leap into a Boat that is adorn'd and aſſign'd for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102922:196"/>
Three Prizes are allow'd to each <hi>Regate;</hi> the firſt and ſecond are in Money or Plate, but the third is a Pig of two or three Months old, from whence comes the Revilings of the <hi>Gondoliers, Terzo di Regate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the firſt Match is over, the <hi>Peotes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Starting-Place, to ſet off another, which is perform'd with the ſame Ceremonies: Yet of all theſe various <hi>Regates,</hi> the Boats with four Oars, that paſs with moſt ſwiftneſs, are not eſteem'd as the pleaſanteſt Sights. Thoſe that are work'd by one Man, whether <hi>Gondolos,</hi> Boats, or <hi>Fiſoleros,</hi> have ſomething that render them much more extraordinary: For you behold a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt <hi>Gondolier</hi> upon the Poop, naked to his mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, his Head bound, his Face pale and fixed, his Body ſtooping to the Oar, all his Muſcles extended, and his Breaſt ſwoln; uſing his utmoſt Efforts to get the better of his Adverſaries: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he is to manage his Strength in ſuch manner as it may laſt him to the end of the Courſe, which is about two Miles.</p>
                     <p>As Skill is not leſs requiſite than Strength in all theſe ſorts of Exerciſes; ſo it is extremely pleaſant to obſerve theſe Men take their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, either in avoiding the force of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Stream, and keeping in the very Heart of the Tide, when it is with them: Or directly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Courſe of the <hi>Peotes,</hi> which by opening of the Water, do render their way more eaſy. Their Artifices do ſometimes proceed farther, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when near each other; for he that has got on Head of the other, ſeldom fails of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly giving his Foot to the Boat of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, by which means he advances himſelf, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102922:197"/>
throws back the other. Yet the <hi>Regates</hi> of the Women, which for their ſingularity, excell all thoſe of the Men; are frequently added to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sight more diverting. For many of the Fiſher-mens Wives being us'd to go off with their Husbands, are in a manner no leſs dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous at this Work than the Men; inſomuch that they of two Oars, have oftentimes done very extraordinary Matters in theſe Occaſions. But as the Women have not that Vigour and Boldneſs, which is neceſſary in Attempts of this nature; ſo the Prizes that are beſtow'd upon them, are inferiour to thoſe which are deſign'd for the Men.</p>

Theſe are follow'd by the Nobles, the Friends and Relations of the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour, all in the Ducal Veſt of Purple: In which Order they proceed through an incredible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of People, until he comes to St. <hi>Mark's</hi> Palace, where he goes up to the <hi>College,</hi> whoſe Doors are open, according to the Cuſtom that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102922:198"/>
is obſerv'd at the firſt Audiences of Ambaſſadors. He likewiſe is to obſerve the ſame Method in three times Saluting of the <hi>College,</hi> but he takes his Place between the Great Sages, and the laſt of the three Preſidents of the Forty Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which is the Place that belongs to the Envoys of Princes. After having return'd his Thanks to the <hi>Republick,</hi> for his Election, and taken the uſual Oaths; he goes from thence with the ſame Attendance, to the New Procuratory's, where he enters into the Poſſeſſion of his Dignity.</p>
                     <p>If the Finery of the <hi>Mercery,</hi> the concourſe of People, the great number of Maſques, that are permitted, even to enter the <hi>College,</hi> and the Preſence of the Nobility aſſiſting at this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, do render this Shew very Noble and Magnificent; the Return of the Procuratour is no ways leſs Graceful and Stately. He goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>Gondolo</hi> at the Pillars of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> where he is ſaluted by the Cannon of the Galley, that always lyes there; and in caſe there be any more lying ready at <hi>Venice,</hi> they, upon this Occaſion come to an Anchor in the Great <hi>Canal;</hi> where they hang out all their Streamers and Penants; ſaluting him with the Diſcharge of both great and ſmall Shot. In the mean time ſeveral other Barques are Mann'd forth, by the Servants and Dependants of the Procuratour's Family, who mingling among the other Boats, inceſſantly divert them with the Muſick of their Trumpets, and the Diſcharge of their Guns.</p>
                     <p>As the <hi>Gondoliers</hi> of all the reſpective Ferries of the City, are oblig'd to ſet out a <hi>Peote</hi> of ten Oars, to attend this Solemnity, for which they receive half a Ducat, and a certain quantity
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102922:198"/>
of Bread and Wine, that is diſtributed to them at the Houſe of the Procuratour: So nothing can be more delightful than the variety of their Barques; for theſe <hi>Gondoliers,</hi> being deſirous to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, diſguiſe themſelves very odly: For one <hi>Peote</hi> ſeems to be Mann'd by ten <hi>Spaniards</hi> ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly dreſs'd, another by ſo many hump-Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Fellows, the third by as many Men in Womens Apparel; and the others according to their particular Humours: Inſomuch, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible to imagine any thing reſembling to this Sight, who continually paſs backwards and forwards upon the Great <hi>Canal,</hi> with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Huzza's to the Procuratuor; as <hi>Vivat la ca Grimani,</hi> when the Cavalier <hi>Giovanni Grimani</hi> was rais'd to that Dignity. Yet in caſe of any Defraud in the diſtribution of the Bread, the Wine and the Money, as happen'd at a preceding Election; theſe Huzza's and Acclamations of Joy, are then but feebly repeated; as likewiſe the whole medly of this Confuſion, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the principal part of the Feaſt. So that by this means it ſometimes happens, that the Thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the good Management is viſibly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, through the whole Courſe of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.</p>
                     <p>Such a Rejoycing is not ended in one Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, but the Diverſion is for three Days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, by Balls at the Houſe of the New Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatour; where the great Reſort of People, the number of Maſques, the Riches of the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the cooling Liquors, which are not in theſe Occaſions leſs abounding, than at the Marriages of the Nobility; during which, there are not only Fire-works and Bonfires, before the Houſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102922:199"/>
of the Procuratour, but likewiſe throughout the whole City, before thoſe of his Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; which Rejoycings being ever accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the frequent Diſcharges of Powder-Boxes, render this Feaſt not leſs Great and Magnificent, than if the <hi>Republick</hi> had gain'd ſome notable Victory over her Enemies.</p>

The <hi>Caſtelani</hi> are the firſt, who have that Name from the Quarter of <hi>Caſtelo,</hi> in which is the Patriarchal Church at one of the extremities of this City. The others are the <hi>Nicoletti's,</hi> ſo call'd from the Church of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> at the fartheſt end of the Quarter, which has the greateſt number of Common People and Fiſhermen, who are the braveſt and thoſe that make the beſt Sport in theſe Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So the Party of the <hi>Nicoletto's</hi> has commonly the Advantage over their Adverſaries the <hi>Caſtelans.</hi> The Animoſity of the People ſeems ſo great in theſe Occaſions, which I am at preſent upon Deſcribing, That one would think a People brought up in theſe Partialities, and in this manner ſo ſtrangely divided ſhould never be able to live in that Union and Tranquillity which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the preſervation of the State.</p>
                     <p>There are among theſe ſorts of People, ſeveral Heads of the Factions, who really believe, That
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102922:199"/>
they cannot be eſteem'd as Men of Worth, if they engage into the oppoſite Party. Inſomuch that they had rather miſs a good Opportunity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for their Daughters, than to marry them to a Man of the contrary Side. Theſe Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not found to affect the Common People only, but even in ſome meaſure to reach the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, who declare themſelves of the Faction of the Quarter they live in; yet with this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, That they eſteem theſe Boxing-Matches for Diverſions, which the meaner People convert into an Affair of Importance and Reputation. And among the reſt, even the Strangers are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd into the Parties: For ſuch as come to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> from <hi>Chioſa</hi> are eſteem'd as <hi>Caſtelans;</hi> and thoſe who arrive here by <hi>Meſtre,</hi> or by <hi>Fucine,</hi> are reputed <hi>Nicholettis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is no doubt but that the <hi>Republick</hi> can, without much trouble, diſperſe theſe Partialities, by continually preventing the two Parties from coming to Blows, as it ſometimes happens. But the Senate is of the Opinion, That if the People ſhould form a Conſpiracy againſt the State, or the Nobility, that it would be almoſt impoſſible, for two ſuch oppoſite Factions to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſo far, as to joyn in a Deſign of this nature: By which means they think themſelves ſecure of one half, or at leaſt to oppoſe the Deſigns of the other, by the ready Succours they might expect from the contrary Party: And the rather, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the <hi>Caſtelans</hi> eſteem themſelves for a more civiliz'd People than the <hi>Nicoletti's;</hi> as alſo more engag'd to the Nobility, and zealous to the Government: Therefore the <hi>Republick</hi> do's not only tolerate this Diviſion already reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102922:200"/>
in the People; but they likewiſe encreaſe it, by permitting of it to be obſerv'd, in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is acted.</p>
                     <p>If the Preſidents of the Council of Ten, who are the principal Officers of the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould permit the full Liberty of theſe Fights to the People, ſo great is the Animoſity, as likewiſe the deſire of acquiring the Reputation of being a Man <note n="*" place="margin">Che fa ben i pugni.</note> 
                        <hi>that uſes his Fiſts well,</hi> ſo ſtrong among the <hi>Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> and Populace; That theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes would not only happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Holy-day, as they frequently do upon certain Bridges of the City; but they would undoubtedly become common to the Day, even throughout all the Seaſons of the Year. The difficulty which is found in preventing theſe Fights, when any of the Preſidents of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Ten are againſt it; may be admitted as a very good Inſtance of what is here ſaid. For the Captain of the <hi>Sbirri's</hi> and his People, are ſcarce able to get thoſe Orders obey'd, being the Guard that is placed upon Saint <hi>Barnaby's</hi> Bridge, which is the uſual Field of Battel, and do's only prevent them at that Place; for they are ſure to ſeek others more remote, rather than to be depriv'd of the pleaſure of Fighting.</p>
                     <p>Such of the <hi>Gondoliers</hi> as have acquir'd the Reputation of good Boxers, will not hire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, unleſs they are permitted, by the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſignalize themſelves in theſe Famous Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Even the little Children, that acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally meet in the Streets, do demand of each other, who they are for; and if they are of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Factions, they are certain not to part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102922:200"/>
Blows. The Humour runs ſtrangely upon this rough Exerciſe, for the people do ever ſtop to behold and encourage them; even to ſuch a degree, that the moſt general Diverſion of this City, is the Sight of the <hi>Pugni,</hi> as they are practis'd in almoſt all the Seaſons of the Year; being ſometimes ſeen, even when the Ice is in the <hi>Canals.</hi> The order that I did propoſe to my ſelf, has not permited me to ſpeak of it in any other Place; ſo I ſhall Conclude the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Publick <hi>Recreations,</hi> with that of theſe <hi>Fights,</hi> which are of three different ſorts; <hi>viz. La Montre, La Frotte,</hi> and the <hi>Battel-Array.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La Montre</hi> is that ſort of Fight which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Hand to Hand, between two Men, but with very ſingular Circumſtances. The Bridge of St. <hi>Barnaby</hi> is uſually the <hi>Theater</hi> of theſe <hi>Tragy-Comedies;</hi> for this Bridge hath an equal number of Steps on each ſide, as likewiſe two Keys, almoſt of an equal bigneſs, which is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Parties of the two Factions; ſo that the Advantages in all reſpects are equal on both ſides: Moreover, the <hi>Canal</hi> is long and directly ſtraight, whoſe Houſes are by this means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſcituated for the great number of Spectators that flock hither from all Parts of the City, ſo ſoon as theſe Boxing-Matches are known. The Houſes and Windows are not only fill'd with them, but likewiſe the tops of the Houſes; the Keys and Neighbouring Bridges are cover'd with 'em, as alſo the Barques and <hi>Gondolo's</hi> in the <hi>Canal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet the particular Matches are not begun un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Godfathers are come to the Bridge. Theſe are two ſerious and notable Burgers, who have
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102922:201"/>
by their Valour in theſe ſorts of Exerciſes, rais'd themſelves to the Dignity of Arbiters of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Judges of the Bravery of the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: Theſe Worthies lay by their Cloaks, and after ſeveral Conferences on both ſides, for the Regulation of ſuch things as might otherwiſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a Difference, they go up to the Top of the Bridge, which is built like others; that is, flat about four or five Paces in length, and three or four in breadth, Pav'd with Brick, and rais'd on each ſide with Free-Stone, but without any Rails, or other Security. Theſe are the Principal Articles of the Fight.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>They are not to ſtrike their Adverſary when they have thrown him upon the Ground, without paſſing for mean-ſpirited, and unworthy the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Fighting; therefore the Judges do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately part them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Victory ſhall be declared in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half that firſt draws Blood of his Adverſary at the Noſe, Mouth, or the Face, which is call'd</hi> romper il muſtaccio &amp; eſſer rotte: <hi>But as the Combatants are not obliged to open their Mouths, and to ſhew if thoſe ſlaps on the Chops have not mov'd the Blood; ſo it is very ridiculouſly pleaſant to ſee them keep their Lips cloſe ſhut, and making Signs to the Judges, that they are not out of Heart, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to diſpute the Victory to their utmoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>That in caſe there is no Blood ſhed on either ſide, in the firſt three Heats, the Combatants ſhall go off, and make way for others; but they are made to Embrace by the Judges, and ſo part good Friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>He that throws his Adverſary into the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>is to have a double Victory adjudged to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>And Laſtly, If one of either Party preſents</hi>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:102922:201"/>
                        <hi>himſelf, and none of the other dare to diſpute it with him, as it ſometimes happens; that this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſhall not be leſs eſteem'd, than if he had Vanquiſh'd his Rival.</hi> So he that meets with this Piece of good Fortune ſhews himſelf not a little proud of it; for having ſome time ſtood to offer himſelf, to all that are willing to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Challenge, he ſalutes the Company with a Leg and his Cap, and retires.</p>
                     <p>When Matters are thus order'd, the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are on both Sides equal, to go firſt up to the Bridge, for to ſhew themſelves the firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners of theſe Exerciſes, who get immediately free of their Shoes and Waſtcoats, and ſlipping their Shirts down to the Waſte, they roll it about them, with the long Saſhes which they uſually wear. They have a Glove on their Right Hand, to the end the Fiſt may be the firmer, and their Hair being tuck'd up under their Caps, they place themſelves at the two Angles, oppoſite to the Platform of the Bridge; and the two God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers take their Standings on the other two ſides; leaving to them the full Liberty of the Field of Battel.</p>
                     <p>It is no ſmall matter of Admiration to ſee with what Strength and Fury the ſtouteſt of theſe Fellows do accompany the <note place="margin">Paraſſalto.</note> Blows they give their Adverſaries; the Sound of which may be almoſt as far heard as ſeen, which are commonly made at the Face or the ſmall of the Ribbs; inſomuch, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one of them is knock'd down with the firſt ſtroke of his Enemy, when it chances to light full upon his Chin or Temple, which lays him as flat as if he were Thunder-Struck. To ſee them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102922:202"/>
thus tumble inanimate, and frequently breaking their Heads in the Fall; one would not imagine that it ſhou'd paſs for a trifle, and they recover again.</p>
                     <p>Others are ſo vigorous and ſure of their ſtrokes, which they repeat with ſo much Dexterity and Agility, without ever coming to cloſing, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving time to their Adverſaries to look about them, but quickly oblige them to ſeek their Safety, by leaping into the <hi>Canal;</hi> immediately expreſſing the Joy of ſo compleat a Victory, with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding Capers, which are accompanied by the repeated Huzza's of the People of that Faction. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentry, who are at the Windows on that ſide of the Bridge with their Party, are uſually thoſe who make the moſt noiſe, and that ſhew themſeves moſt affected with theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; who ſtretching themſelves out of the Windows, flouriſh their Handkerchiefs in Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Victory's being on their ſide; as likewiſe to animate the remaining Combatants, to an ample Performance of their Parts.</p>
                     <p>However, thoſe Accidents are no ſooner over, and the Combatants retir'd to their reſpective Parties, but their Places are inſtantly poſſeſs'd by two others, who, that they may not loſe time, do generally ſtand ready-ſtripp'd, and in a Poſture of engaging. This uſually continues a whole Afternoon, before the Victory becomes determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; upon which, the Succeſsful have no other Prize, than the Reputation and Glory of their brave Actions, which they are ſufficiently careful to perpetuate, even to Poſterity. For many of them will have themſelves painted in the Poſture they are accuſtomed to Fight, with their Names,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102922:202"/>
and the Particulars of their mighty Deeds.</p>
                     <p>The latter end of the Day is concluded with reckoning up the Number of Battels won and loſt of each ſide, which is ever very Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Superiour Party: But what is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, is the number of thoſe that are thrown into the <hi>Canal;</hi> as being what the Combatants do moſt endeavour to avoid, after they are come to Cloſing, by uſing their utmoſt Efforts to preſerve themſelves from the diſ-reputation of ſuch an Overthrow; rather chuſing the worſt of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, from thoſe terrible Falls that ſometimes happen to them, by lighting upon the Steps of the Bridge, than to be thrown into the Water, where they meet with no Contuſions. But the pleaſanteſt Sight of all, is to behold one of theſe Fellows thrown over the Bridge, yet hanging by his Adverſary's Hair, and the other endeavouring to avoid being drawn into the Water by him, who is moſt an end finally oblig'd to follow him into the <hi>Canal,</hi> where the Water parts them; For no ſooner are they over the Bridge, and from the Ground, but all Animoſities ceaſe; each of them ſtrugling for himſelf, and they the ſame good Friends they were before the Fight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La Frotte</hi> is an Engagement of ſeveral that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Accidentally, and without Deſign; but proceeds from the <note place="margin">La Frotte.</note> Impatience which the Crowd of Combatants ſhew, when they are once got to the Rendezvous, and the Judges not come regularly to receive the ſeveral Parties, according to the way of the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</hi> The Children being got firſt up to the Bridge, in imitation of the Men, do commonly begin to Skirmiſh: The great Boys inſenſibly ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102922:203"/>
themſelves with them, render the Diſpute ſo warm, until at length the Men thinking their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours concern'd for to be Maſters of the Bridge, do likewiſe engage in the ſame Fray. Then is the Fight at the higheſt pitch, for each Party endeavours their utmoſt to drive off the Enemy: This Controverſy is maintain'd with ſo much Obſtinacy and Heat, that great numbers of them are tumbled into the <hi>Canal;</hi> who notwithſtanding their being cloathed, do ſeem no more concern'd than if they had fell upon Straw.</p>
                     <p>Such as do not Fight, on theſe Occaſions uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to excite their Parties to behave themſelves Gallantly. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentlemen encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Contenders, by ſometimes promiſing them to Reward their Courage. It has ſeveral times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penned, that ſome of theſe Nobles have been ſo zealous for the Reputation of their Factions; that through In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to thoſe of their Party that have not behav'd themſelves to their Minds, they have gone from the Bridge, and ſtripping themſelves of their Veſts, have eſpous'd the Party with the beſt of their Endeavours; by their Example inſpiring Courage to the Vanquiſh'd, and bringing them off with Victory, or at leaſt by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more Honourably contended for it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Battel-Array</hi> is a General Engagement that is made between the two Factions; but with all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Precautions that can be taken between the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to render the Fight more Equal, that ſo the Glory may be entire to the Victorious. When Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> was at <hi>Venice,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Delfino</hi> that Entertain'd him, was very deſirous to have ſhewn him this Diverſion, and was accordingly a conſiderable time Negotiating with the Heads of both the Parties, to induce them to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and famous Battel. The Difficulties were ſo great, that the Cardinal in Perſon ſollicited thoſe of the Artiſans, that had the greateſt Authority in their Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: He went to their Shops, careſs'd, intreated, and promis'd them to beſtow a conſiderable Prize on the Victorious.</p>
                     <p>Matters were at length agreed on, a Bridge was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen upon the Key of the <hi>Incurables,</hi> which is very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102922:203"/>
The Steps were made larger that were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſmaller than thoſe on the other ſide of the Bridge; and certain Places of the Key were taken in with Planks, which otherwiſe would have permitted more ſpace to the <hi>Nicoletti's,</hi> than it was poſſible for the <hi>Caſtelans</hi> to have. The Fury of the Combat wholly poſſeſs'd the Thoughts of the People, nothing elſe was diſcours'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; inſomuch that it ſeem'd as if the entire O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of one of the Parties was at hand. But the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of the Council of Ten, with much reaſon fearing that this Animoſity, which had hitherto never appear'd ſo great, might be attended with dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; thought it abſolutely requiſite to forbid the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel: So unleſs theſe Parties do ſecretly agree between themſelves, there is no general Battel, or <hi>Guerra ordinata</hi> to be ſeen; yet when it happens, the greateſt part of the Combatants provide themſeves with Back and Breaſt-Pieces of Gilt Paſtboard, which they put over their Naked Bodies, both for the finery of the Shew, as alſo to break the force of their Adverſaries Stroaks.</p>
                     <p>The Victory of this Battel, conſiſts in getting Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Bridge, for which reaſon it do's not ſo much depend upon the dint of Blows, as upon the Endeavours of both Parties to drive away their Adverſaries. Yet that the Diſpute may begin upon equal Terms, the Combatants put themſelves in order: The firſt Ranks are brought cloſe to each other, upon the very Center of the Bridge: Then they begin to break each others Ranks with the greateſt Fury; but being well ſupported, and each ſide alternatively puſh'd by the other, ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Efforts are uſually made, by the great number of Contenders, that they in the firſt Ranks are of courſe born from the Ground; or the main Bodies being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer join'd than the Flanks, thoſe of both the Right and Left ſides, are conſequently ſo violently preſs'd by the Center, as they are ſometimes forc'd to leap into the Water, by Ffties and Sixties at a time.</p>
                     <p>In this Condition, only the firſt Ranks of the two Parties are able to Fight, who are yet oblig'd to hold their Hands up, to have the free Exerciſe of them: The hindmoſt are ſure to get upon their Companions, and

paſſing over their Heads go to Attack their Enemies, whoſe Noſes and Faces would undoubtedly ſuffer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Danger to the Aſſailants; if they of the contrary Party did not take the ſame Method; inſomuch that the Fight of this ſecond Story becomes more terrible than the other: In which Occaſions the utmoſt Endeavours being repeated, with all imaginable Fury, to bring each others Flanks into Diſorder; the greateſt Confuſions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; at which time they are born by Crowds into the <hi>Canal.</hi> Inſomuch, that it is really wonderful that theſe Fights are not terminated with the Death of a great many of the Combatants. Beſides, the Heat of their Contention do's ſo Animate this Multitude of People, and the Indignation of the Inferior Party is ſo great, that they would undoubtedly betake themſelves to their Arms, if the Order was not very exact and rigorous in preventing the Danger of theſe Accidents. However, it has ſometimes happen'd, that the Pavement of the Key has been torn up, to make uſe of the Stones, for want of other Arms, whereby it is not without ſome reaſon that this Fight is call'd by the <hi>Venetians, una ſtragge di Chriſtiani.</hi>

                     <p>The Rejoycings of the Victorious are continu'd for three Days after the Fight, for which purpoſe a Boat is Adorn'd with Garlands, and a great Crown hung in the middle, which they conduct with Beat of Drum, thro' all the <hi>Canals</hi> and Quarters of their Party; as likewiſe to the Houſes of the Nobles as moſt eſpous'd their Cauſe, who always beſtow ſome Money or Barrels of Wine on them, to Solemnize the Glory of the Victory. By Night they walk up and down with Flambeau's of Straw, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the Boys, who run after them on the Keys, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually Huzzaing the Name of their Faction. The Vanquiſhed are on the contrary ſo mortifi'd, as ſome of them dare not return to their Habitations; for their Wives have ſometimes not only refus'd them Entrance, but driven them away; reviling their Cowardize with the moſt injurious Terms, <hi>Via di qua infami, por chi vituperoſi.</hi>
